Thus, mitochondrial\ncomplex inhibitors are often used for the development of experimental PD. In this study, we used\nrotenone to create in vitro cell models of PD, then used these models to investigate the effects of\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF), a monosaccharide with protective effects against a range of cytotoxic\nsubstances. Subsequently, we investigated the possible mechanisms of these protective effects in PC12\ncells. The protection of 1,5-AF against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity was con\ufb01rmed by increased cell\nviability and longer dendritic lengths in PC12 and primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, in rotenone-\ntreated PC12 cells, 1,5-AF upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1\n(PGC-1\u03b1) expression and enhanced its deacetylation, while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase\n(AMPK) phosphorylation. 1,5-AF treatment also increased mitochondrial activity in these cells.\nMoreover, PGC-1 \u03b1silencing inhibited the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF\nin PC12 cells. Therefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1through AMPK activation, thus leading to\nmitochondrial biogenic and cytoprotective effects. Together, our results suggest that 1,5-AF has\ntherapeutic potential for development as a treatment for PD.\nKeywords: 1,5-AF; 1,5-AG; metformin; Parkinson\u2019s disease; parkinsonism; AMPK; PGC-1 \u03b1; mito-\nchondria; mitochondrial biogenesis; rotenone\n1. Introduction\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases,\nespecially among older individuals. Because the aged population is gradually increas-\ning worldwide, treatments that inhibit the progression of this disease are increasingly\nimportant [ 1,2]. The causes and pathomechanisms of PD remain largely unknown; how-\never, it has been postulated that intrinsic or extrinsic neurotoxic metabolites or substances\nparticipate in its pathogenesis [ 3]. PD is strongly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9941. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22189941 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms",

Question: What is the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and its potential relationship with Parkinson's disease?\nAnswer: PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the process of increasing intracellular mitochondrial components and energy capacity. Recent studies have demonstrated decreased expression of PGC-1\u03b1-regulated genes in many Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and increased PGC-1\u03b1 expression protecting against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. The relationship between PD and mitochondrial biogenesis is still unclear, but neurotoxin-induced models like rotenone may provide clues about their connection.\nReason: This question delves into the specific role of PGC-1\u03b1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and its potential implications for Parkinson's disease, which is a central topic in the given context. The answer summarizes the current understanding of PGC-1\u03b1's involvement in PD and highlights the need for further research to elucidate their connection.\n2. Question: How does 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and what are the potential therapeutic implications of this activation for Parkinson's disease?\nAnswer: While the exact mechanism is not specified in the given context, it is mentioned that 1,5-AF activates AMPK, which is known to lead to mitochondrial biogenic activity via PGC-1\u03b1. The cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF against proinflammatory and cytotoxic substances and its potential as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease are also suggested.\nReason: This question focuses on the specific mechanism through which 1,5-AF may exert its potential therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease by activating AMPK. The answer highlights the connection between AMPK activation and mitochondrial biogenesis and implies that 1,5-AF could be a promising candidate for PD treatment due to these actions.\n3. Question: What are the environmental and genetic risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease according to the latest research?\nAnswer: Environmental risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease include exposure to pesticides and some metals, while genetic risk factors involve genes like PARK2 and PARK6. The relationship between Parkinson's disease and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) has also been demonstrated in recent years, with decreased expression of PGC-1\u03b1-regulated genes in many PD patients and increased PGC-1\u03b1 expression protecting against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity.\nReason: This question asks about the most recent findings regarding environmental and genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease, which is a crucial aspect of the given context. The answer summarizes the known risks and highlights the importance of further research to understand their roles in the development of PD.\n4.

Additionally, rotenone\nand other substances that inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain may have\nroles in developing PD [ 7\u20139]. Rotenone is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces\napoptosis by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species [ 10]. Rotenone is often used\nto create animal and cell models to study the pathomechanisms of PD; it is also used to\naid in developing treatments and interventions for PD [ 11]. In addition, the relationship\nbetween PD and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1(PGC-1\u03b1),\na protein involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, has been demonstrated in recent years.\nZheng et al. reported that the expression of PGC-1 \u03b1-regulated genes is decreased in many\nPD patients [ 12], while Siddiqui et al. demonstrated that increased PGC-1 \u03b1expression\nprotects against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity [ 13]. Furthermore, O\u2019Donnell et al. reported that\nPGC-1\u03b1protects axons from \u03b1-synuclein toxicity in a zebra\ufb01sh model [ 14].\nPGC-1\u03b1is a transcriptional coactivator that binds to and co-activates transcription\nfactors, leading to mitochondrial biogenesis. The process of mitochondrial biogenesis is\ncomplex, from the transcription of genes related to mitochondria to increased intracellular\nmitochondrial components and energy capacity. Little is known about how mitochondrial\nbiogenesis might play a role in the pathology of PD. However, it is expected that models\ninduced by neurotoxins, such as rotenone, will provide clues to the relationship between\nPD and mitochondrial biogenesis.\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) is a monosaccharide that is directly formed from\nstarch and glycogen in food by the action of \u03b1-1,4-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.2.13) in the\nliver [ 15\u201317]. It is then reduced to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) and reabsorbed in\nthe kidney. 1,5-AG is usually maintained at a constant level in the blood. It is used clini-\ncally as a marker of glucose metabolism, and its blood concentration is decreased in poorly\ncontrolled diabetic patients [ 18]. Although 1,5-AG is not thought to be used as an energy\nsource, blood levels of 1,5-AG are maintained in a constant range; however, the reason for\nthis remains unknown. The chemical structure of 1,5-AF and brief summaries of related\nenzymatic reactions are shown in Figure 1.\u03b3 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1Figure 1. Chemical structure of 1,5-AF and related enzymatic reactio ns. 1,5-AF, 1,5-anhydro- D-fructose .\nWe have previously reported the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF against a range of\nproin\ufb02ammatory and cytotoxic substances, including lipopolysaccharides [ 17,19]. We\nalso have data suggesting that 1,5-AF activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)\n(unpublished data). Furthermore, it has been reported that metformin, which is currently\nthe most popular antidiabetic medicine, also activates AMPK, leading to mitochondrial\nbiogenic activity via PGC-1 \u03b1[20].\nWe, therefore, used rotenone to create cell models of PD and investigated the effects of\n1,5-AF in these models. Based on these observations, we then examined the cytoprotective\neffects of 1,5-AF on rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in vitro using cultured neuronal cells. We\ndemonstrated that 1,5-AF had cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects. Together,\nour results suggest that 1,5-AF may have therapeutic potential for development as a\ntreatment for PD.",

Results\n2.1. 1,5-AF Ameliorates Rotenone-Induced Cytotoxic Effects in a Dose-Dependent Manner\nIncreasing concentrations of rotenone caused dose-dependent decreases in cell vi-\nability (Supplementary Figure S1). Because 50% of PC12 cells survived at a rotenone\nconcentration of 1 \u00b5M, PC12 cells were stimulated with rotenone at 1 \u00b5M for 24 h. The MTT\nassay results demonstrated that when 1,5-AF was added in the range of 0\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL, cell\nviability (average \u00b1SD) was 68 \u00b11% and 63 \u00b12% with 1,5-AF concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL\nand 100\u00b5g/mL, respectively, compared with 45 \u00b15% in the control group, indicating that\nrotenone signi\ufb01cantly prevented cell death ( p= 0.001 and p= 0.015, respectively; two-way\nANOVA; Figure 2a). In addition, cell imaging using calcein AM staining ( Figure 2b,c)\nrevealed that 50 \u00b5g/mL 1,5-AF signi\ufb01cantly inhibited rotenone-induced cell death com-\npared with 10 \u00b5g/mL 1,5-AF in terms of cell counts (average \u00b1SD;13,508\u00b1619 cells and\n10,466\u00b1334 cells, respectively; p= 0.004). These \ufb01ndings indicate that 1,5-AF tends to\ninhibit rotenone-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effects\nof 1,5-AF against 50 nM rotenone-induced cell death over 24 h ( p< 0.05, compared with\nrotenone + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment) were also con\ufb01rmed in mouse\nprimary neuronal cells (Figure 3a). These results suggest that 1,5-AF has an inhibitory\neffect on rotenone-induced cytotoxicity.\nFigure 2. Effects of 1,5-AF against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in cultured PC12 cells.

Figure 5b shows an analysis\nof immunoprecipitation with anti-PGC-1 \u03b1antibody followed by immunoblotting of the\nsample with acetylated lysine (ACC-Ly) and total PGC-1 \u03b1, respectively. Based on previous\nreports that PGC-1 \u03b1is activated by deacetylation [ 21], an increase in ACC-Ly was taken\nto mean a decrease in activated PGC-1 \u03b1. 1,5-AF treatment resulted in a reduced ratio\nof ACC-Ly to total PGC-1 \u03b1(p< 0.05, compared with rotenone + PBS treatment), which\nimplied increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1(Figure 5b). Our \ufb01ndings suggest that the\nratio of activated PGC-1 \u03b1was increased by 1,5-AF treatment in rotenone-stimulated PC12\ncells. Notably, 1,5-AF alone also tended to increase the expression and activation of PGC-\n1\u03b1. Finally, 1,5-AF treatment increased the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK (i.e., activated\nAMPK) to total AMPK in rotenone-stimulated PC12 cells ( p< 0.05, compared with rotenone\n+ PBS treatment; Figure 5c). Overall, our \ufb01ndings suggest that 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1\nin an AMPK-dependent manner in rotenone-stimulated PC12 cells.",

MitoTracker was used for\nmitochondrial staining. The import of MitoTracker into mitochondria depends on many\nfactors, e.g., mitochondrial mass, number of mitochondria per cell, and mitochondrial\nmembrane potential. 1,5-AF signi\ufb01cantly increased intracellular MitoTracker intensity\n(p< 0.01; Figure 7a,b). In addition, under rotenone stimulation, MitoTracker intensity\ndemonstrated a relative increase after 1,5-AF administration (Supplementary Figure S3);\nhowever, this change was unable to be evaluated absolutely because rotenone may de-\ncrease MitoTracker intensity by decreasing the membrane potential. Furthermore, 1,5-AF\nsigni\ufb01cantly increased intracellular ATP levels under conditions of rotenone exposure\n(p< 0.05; Figure 7c). These results indicate that 1,5-AF treatment increased MitoTracker\nintensity per cell with or without rotenone administration and suppressed the decrease in\nmitochondrial activity caused by rotenone exposure.\n2.5. PGC-1 \u03b1Silencing Inhibits the Effects of 1,5-AF on Mitochondria\nTo assess whether PGC-1 \u03b1is a crucial molecule for the effects of 1,5-AF treatment in\nincreasing MitoTracker intensity, we silenced PGC-1 \u03b1in PC12 cells. As shown in Figure\n8, in PC12 cells transfected with PP ARGC1A siRNA, 1,5-AF did not increase MitoTracker\nintensity per cell (Figure 8a,b). In contrast, in the control group, 1,5-AF signi\ufb01cantly in-\ncreased MitoTracker intensity per cell ( p< 0.05; Figure 8c,d). Even with rotenone treatment,\nthe 1,5-AF-induced increase in MitoTracker intensity was canceled in PC12 cells transfected\nwith PP ARGC1A siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4). Together, these results suggest that\ntransfection with PP ARGC1A siRNA inhibited the effects of 1,5-AF on MitoTracker intensity\nper cell.",

Discussion\nThe monosaccharide 1,5-AF that was used in the present study is constantly pro-\nduced from starch in very tiny amounts in the liver through the action of \u03b1-1,4-glucan\nlyase [ 15\u201317,19].This 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG, which can be used as a urinary\nmarker of renal function because 1,5-AG is reabsorbed from glucose transporter type 4\n(GLUT-4) [ 24]. However, the physiological functions of 1,5-AF and 1,5-AG remain un-\nknown. We therefore investigated the physiological functions of 1-5-AF. We have previously\nsucceeded in producing 1,5-AF in vitro from sweet potatoes [ 24]. In the present study, we\ndemonstrated that this 1,5-AF had cytoprotective effects that were exerted by protecting\nmitochondria from the mitochondrial toxin rotenone, which causes parkinsonism. Based\non these data, we propose that 1,5-AF may have therapeutic potential for the treatment\nof PD.\nIn the current study, the addition of increasing amounts of 1,5-AF prevented rotenone-\ninduced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in the PC12 cell line and primary neuronal\ncells. The cytoprotective activity of 1,5-AF against rotenone was also con\ufb01rmed by cellular\nimaging using calcein AM staining and through assessments of dendritic length in cultured\nprimary neuronal cells. There are two possible interpretations regarding these dendritic\nchanges. The \ufb01rst possibility is that the promotion of mitochondrial function enhances\nthat dendrite formation. This possibility is supported by our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF increased\nthe length of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive spines in neurons without\nrotenone treatment. Similarly, Li et al. reported [ 25] that mitochondrial activation increases\ndendritic spine length. The second possibility is that 1,5-AF inhibits rotenone-induced\ncell death. Dendritic spines are known to change morphologically early in the process of\nneuronal death, which is known as dendritic beading [ 26,27]. This has been observed as\na neuronal disorder in PD, and it has been reported that dendrites become shorter in the\nstriatum of PD patients [ 28,29]. Furthermore, one sign of dendritic beading is shortened\ndendritic length. Thus, our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF treatment reversed the rotenone-induced\ndendritic shortening suggests that 1,5-AF has cytoprotective effects.\nFurthermore, metformin is known to have mitochondrial protective activity [ 20]. In\nparticular, metformin reportedly activates AMPK, which in turn activates mitochondrial\nbiogenesis via PGC-1 \u03b1. AMPK is a major activator of various molecules and is believed\nto be activated by phosphorylation [ 23]. Activated AMPK then activates PGC-1 \u03b1via the\nactivation of SIRT1 [ 30,31]. PGC-1\u03b1is activated by deacetylation [ 31,32], and activated PGC-\n1\u03b1causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 33]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is the process by which\ncells increase the mass and copy number of individual mitochondria, thereby increasing\nATP production. Metformin is known to activate AMPK in hepatocytes and muscle\ncells [ 34]. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, metformin activates AMPK, increases\nexpression of PGC-1 \u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 22]. Furthermore, metformin\nincreases phosphorylated AMPK, increases expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) and\nPGC-1\u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells [ 23].\nIn the present study, treatment with metformin also led to increased dendritic length\ncompared with rotenone-treated cells. However, the 1,5-AF metabolite 1,5-AG did not have\nthis effect. Thus, although 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG in the kidney, the present\nstudy results suggest that this reduction does not occur rapidly in neuronal cell culture.\nIn addition, a relatively high concentration of metformin had protective effects against\nrotenone-induced mitochondrial toxicity in PC12 cells in the present study. In contrast, a\nrelatively low concentration of 1,5-AF had similar protective effects. These \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat, compared with metformin, 1,5-AF may have greater therapeutic potential against\nPD. However, to our knowledge, there have been relatively few investigations regarding\nthe metabolism and synthesis of 1,5-AF in the human body. In humans, potential clinical\napplications require in vivo analyses of 1,4-glucan lyase overexpression and the potential\ninhibition of 1,5-AF metabolism in the kidney.\nIn the current study, we also con\ufb01rmed that 1,5-AF upregulated PGC-1 \u03b1expression\nand enhanced its deacetylation, despite the presence of rotenone.

QAR 1\nQuestion: How does 1,5-AF affect PGC-1\u03b1 expression and AMPK phosphorylation in the absence of rotenone?\nAnswer: In the absence of rotenone, 1,5-AF treatment led to increased deacetylation of PGC-1\u03b1 and induced PGC-1\u03b1 expression. It also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that it may activate PGC-1\u03b1 in an AMPK-dependent manner leading to mitochondrial biogenic activity and cytoprotection.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the effects of 1,5-AF on PGC-1\u03b1 expression and AMPK phosphorylation in the absence of rotenone, which is a specific aspect of the study that sets it apart from other research on this topic.\n2. QAR 2\nQuestion: What role does PGC-1\u03b1 play in the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF treatment?\nAnswer: PGC-1\u03b1 appears to be essential for both the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment. Silencing PGC-1\u03b1 by siRNA transfection inhibited the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF and its ability to activate AMPK leading to PGC-1\u03b1 activation, which contributes to mitochondrial protection and proliferation.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the specific role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF treatment, which is a key finding of the study that has not been extensively explored in previous research.\n3. QAR 3\nQuestion: What are the limitations of the current study on 1,5-AF and rotenone?\nAnswer: The current study had several limitations, including the inability to confirm in vitro effects in vivo due to regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan, the simultaneous administration of rotenone and 1,5-AF in the study, and the inability to test the effects of 1,5-AG and metformin in all of the presented experimental conditions.\nReason: This question is unique because it highlights the specific limitations of the current study on 1,5-AF and rotenone, which are important considerations for future research on this topic.\n4. QAR 4\nQuestion: How does 1,5-AF affect dendritic length and mitochondrial biogenesis in the absence of rotenone?\nAnswer: In the absence of rotenone, 1,5-AF treatment increased dendritic length and mitochondrial biogenesis but did not significantly increase PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels. This may be related to the considerable variability in observed PGC-1\u03b1 levels; however, these levels tended to increase without rotenone treatment.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the effects of 1,5-AF on dendritic length and mitochondrial biogenesis in the absence of rotenone, which is a specific aspect of the study that has not been extensively explored in previous research.\n5. QAR 5\nQuestion: What are potential therapeutic effects of PGC-1\u03b1 in an in vivo model?\nAnswer: Future studies should consider directly targeting PGC-1\u03b1 levels and investigate the potential therapeutic effects of this protein in an in vivo model.

Moreover, 1,5-AF treatment led to increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1in vitro while\ninducing PGC-1 \u03b1expression. 1,5-AF treatment also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation;\ntherefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1in an AMPK-dependent manner leading to mi-\ntochondrial biogenic activity and cytoprotection.

Additionally, 1,5-AF without rotenone treatment increased dendritic length\nand mitochondrial biogenesis, but it did not signi\ufb01cantly increase PGC-1 \u03b1protein levels.\nThis may be related to the considerable variability in observed PGC-1 \u03b1levels; nonetheless,\nthese levels tended to increase without rotenone treatment.\nThe cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF were inhibited when PGC-1 \u03b1was silenced by\nPP ARGC1A siRNA transfection. In addition, although 1,5-AF treatment led to increased\nMitoTracker intensity and activity of mitochondria, these effects were also inhibited when\nPGC-1\u03b1was silenced. Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that PGC-1 \u03b1is essential for both\nthe cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment. While we\ncannot rule out the possibility that 1,5-AF is involved in other unidenti\ufb01ed pathways, the\n\ufb01ndings in PP ARGC1A siRNA experiments suggest that the primary pathway is as follows:\n1,5-AF activates AMPK leading to PGC-1 \u03b1activation, which contributes to mitochondrial\nprotection and proliferation. As mentioned above, these effects may be present in the\nabsence of rotenone; they also appear to be essential for protection against rotenone-\ninduced cytotoxicity. Future studies (based on our preliminary in vitro \ufb01ndings) should\nconsider directly targeting PGC-1 \u03b1levels and investigate the potential therapeutic effects\nof this protein in an in vivo model.\nThis study had some limitations. First, we could not con\ufb01rm the in vitro effects in vivo\nbecause of regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan. To test the\neffects of 1,5-AF in vivo , we are currently developing a PD animal model using alternative\nmethods. These methods include a Drosophila model, in which rotenone treatment can\ninduce mitochondrial defects and dopaminergic neuronal loss [ 35]. Second, in the current\nstudy, rotenone and 1,5-AF were generally administered simultaneously. In PD in humans,\nhowever, cell loss begins long before therapeutics can be administered. Thus, future studies\nshould explore the effects of 1,5-AF at a range of time points after rotenone exposure. Our\npreliminary analysis suggested a potential cytoprotective effect in PC12 cells exposed to\nrotenone for 1 h, followed by exposure to 1,5-AF in rotenone-free media for 24 h ( p< 0.05,\ncompared with rotenone alone; Supplementary Figure S5). These effects imply the potential\nfor development and eventual application in the treatment of patients with current PD;\nto our knowledge, there is no oral medication that can fully reverse the effects of PD in\nclinical practice. Third, we could not test the effects of 1,5-AG and metformin in all of\nthe presented experimental conditions. Concerning 1,5-AG, we were limited by \ufb01nancial\nconstraints. At the same time, the effects of metformin in this study depended on the use\nof a high drug dose, which affected other experimental reagents and made measurements\nchallenging. We suspect that these changes in experimental reagents may have been related\nto cellular acidosis, based on the side effect of lactic acidosis observed during the clinical\napplication of metformin [ 36,37]. Notably, we excluded metformin from experiments\nother than those shown in Figures 4\u20136because those \ufb01ndings strongly implied that the\neffects of 1,5-AF were similar to those of metformin; this is consistent with a published\napproach [ 22]. In future studies, we will explore the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AG in a\nmore extensive range of experiments. Fourth, some assessments of cytoprotective effects\n(i.e., results in Figure 4) were performed using pooled data; the resulting variability among\nconditions may have in\ufb02uenced the strength of statistical comparisons. Fifth, mitochondrial\nmembrane potential may be reduced upon rotenone administration; thus, the intracellular\nmitochondrial mass estimated by the MitoTracker assay may be lower under conditions of\nrotenone administration [ 38]. In future analyses of 1,5-AF, the mitochondrial mass should\nbe investigated by using \ufb02uorescent probes such as nonyl acridine orange, for which\nmitochondrial uptake is unaffected by membrane potential [ 39].",

The concentration of rotenone at which 50% of PC12 cells\nsurvived was 1 \u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S1). In experiments with primary mouse\nneuronal cells, rotenone was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 50 nM, based on\nprevious reports [ 45,46]. Monolayer cells were then treated with or without rotenone\nand with or without either 1,5-AF (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), 1,5-AG (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), or metformin\n(1.25 mM) for 24 h.\n4.3. MTT Assay to Analyze Cell Viability\nPC12 or mouse primary neuronal cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7104cells\nper well) and incubated with DMSO or rotenone (1 \u00b5M) for 24 h. The numbers of live\ncells were then evaluated using the MTT assay, which was performed in accordance with\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Anti-MAP2 Immuno\ufb02uorescence Staining\nThe protective activity of 1,5-AF against the cytotoxic effects of rotenone was evaluated\non the basis of dendritic morphology and length. Dendrites were visualized by staining\nthe cells with an anti-MAP2 antibody. Brie\ufb02y, primary neuronal cells were plated in poly-L-\nlysine-coated 48-well dishes.

The medium was then washed out, and the\nmonolayers were rinsed using saline. For the detection of PGC-1 \u03b1and other proteins,\nimmunoblotting was performed. Brie\ufb02y, cell lysates were diluted 1:1 in 2 \u00d7sample buffer\n(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol,\nand 0.01% bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Next, 5 \u00b5g of protein from each lysate\nwas separated on a polyacrylamide gel, blotted on a polyvinylidene \ufb02uoride membrane,\nand probed with antibodies against PGC-1 \u03b1and the other proteins.

Horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies were used as secondary\nantibodies. Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system\n(Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and measured using ImageJ software.\n4.6. PGC-1 \u03b1Acetylation Assays\nEvaluation of acetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1was detected by immunoprecipitation [ 22], based\non a report that an increased level of ACC-Ly implies a decreased level of deacetylated\nPGC-1\u03b1[47]. In accordance with a published protocol [ 22], PGC-1\u03b1protein was immuno-\nprecipitated with anti-PGC-1 \u03b1antibody (Novus Biologicals) and agarose beads (Santa\nCruz); PGC-1 \u03b1levels and acetylation were then detected using speci\ufb01c antibodies for\nPGC-1\u03b1(Novus Biologicals) and ACC-Ly (Cell Signaling), respectively.\n4.7.

Next, 1/16 diluted Lipofectamine RNAiMAX\nReagent (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c) in Opti-MEM Medium (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c), and\n1/50 diluted siRNA in Opti-MEM Medium were prepared. The diluted siRNA was added\nto the diluted Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Regent (1:1 ratio). Next, the medium in the dishes\nwas replaced with RPMI-1640 and 2% fetal bovine serum, and the siRNA\u2013lipid complex\nwas added to cells (100 mL/well) for 5 min at room temperature.\n4.8. Analysis of Mitochondrial Mass by MitoTracker\nRat PC12 cells were cultured on four-well chamber dishes (Cosmo Bio). The medium\nwas changed to RPMI-1640 with 2% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, DMSO alone or\nrotenone (\ufb01nal concentration, 1 \u00b5M) dissolved in DMSO was added to each well; cells were\nthen treated with PBS alone or 1,5-AF (\ufb01nal concentration 50 \u00b5g/mL) dissolved in PBS for\n24 h. Next, the medium was changed to phenol red-free RPMI-1640 with 2% fetal bovine\nserum; cells were incubated with MitoTracker red (CMH2XROS, Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c;\n\ufb01nal concentration, 1 \u00b5M) and Hoechst 33342 for 1 h. Cells were washed with warmed\nPBS and \ufb01xed in 4% formaldehyde. The \ufb01xed cells were examined under a \ufb02uorescence\nmicroscope (BZ-X700, Keyence Co.). Images were acquired using the same exposure time\nin each well. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Four images were extracted\nfrom the same well. In addition, \ufb01ve cells were selected from each image, the area and\nintensity were measured by ImageJ, and the mean values for each image were calculated.\nTo normalize the MitoTracker staining results, the area density values of the \ufb02uorescent\nimages in each group were divided by the area density values of the \ufb02uorescent images in\nthe DMSO + PBS group (i.e., the normal control group).\n4.9. Intracellular ATP Assay\nATP produced in the wells was measured using the Mitochondrial ToxGlo Assay kit\n(Promega Corporation). Cell medium was replaced with RPMI-1640 with D-(+)-galactose\ninstead of glucose. The assay was then performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocols. For normalization of ATP assay results, the background absorbance value was\nsubtracted from each recorded absorbance value; the resulting value was then divided by\nthe absorbance value of the DMSO + PBS group (i.e., the normal control group).\n4.10. Statistical Analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean \u00b1standard error of the mean.
