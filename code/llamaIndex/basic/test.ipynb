Another minor endothermic event was observed for pure ACV between ~60°C and ~ 175°C (not apparent in the figure). This event may be attributed to the phase transition of polymorphic hydrate form V to anhydrous form III in the range of 65°C and 100°C, and thereafter from form III to anhydrous form VI at higher temperatures. These changes in the thermal characteristics of ACV are not uncommon and have been reported earlier (9, 10, 37). The thermogram of glucosamine HCl (Figure 3B) revealed two, broad, fused endothermic peaks; a larger peak with an onset at ~190°C and a smaller peak in the onset and/or relative areas of the peaks as a function of controlled temperature increases. These interactions may indicate melting, degradation, and/ or incompatibilities between the components of the formulation. The spectra obtained from the infrared analysis of pure ACV, pure glucosamine HCl, the physical mixture (PM, 1:3) of pure ACV and glucosamine HCl, and the prepared ACV-SD are shown in Figure ) revealed two, broad, fused endothermic peaks; a larger peak with an onset at ~190°C and a smaller peak in the onset and/or relative areas of the peaks as a function of controlled temperature increases. These interactions may indicate melting, degradation, and/ or incompatibilities between the components of the formulation. The spectra obtained from the infrared analysis of pure ACV, pure glucosamine HCl, the physical mixture (PM, 1:3) of pure ACV and glucosamine HCl, and the prepared ACV-SD are shown in Figure 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D, respectively.

For pure ACV (Figure 4A), characteristic absorption bands were located at ~3622 cm-1 (primary amine) and 3411 cm -1 (secondary amine, N-H stretching). Additional peaks typically associated with ACV were found at ~1712 cm -1 (C=O stretching), ~1630 cm -1 and ~1609 cm -1 (amine), ~1483 cm -1 (O-H stretching), and ~1347 cm -1 (C-H stretching).

We survey here the major biosynthetic pathways that underlie the biological diversity in glycobiology, with emphasis on glycoproteins, and the approaches that can be used to address the resulting heterogeneity. Included among these are derivatizations, on-and off-line chromatography, electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and a variety of dissociation methods, the recently introduced electronbased techniques being of particular interest.\\n\\nCarbohydrates are the most abundant and structurally diverse compounds found in nature. They participate in various biological processes. They are involved in diverse roles such as molecular recognition, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, energy generation, and modification of protein conformations. Carbohydrates also serve as markers for many disease states. They can be used in the food, textile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Increasing evidence shows that numerous biological functions are closely related to specific carbohydrate structures [1][2][3][4]. They can form branched structures because linkages of the constituent monosaccharides can occur at a number of positions.. They can form branched structures because linkages of the constituent monosaccharides can occur at a number of positions.\\nMonosaccharides, which cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form, are the most basic units of carbohydrates. Monosaccharides constitute oligosaccharides (2-10 units) by the attachment to one another via glycosidic linkages, forming branched or linear chains. Polysaccharides (>10 units) are typically reserved as large glycans that are composed of repeating oligosaccharide motifs. The ring form of a monosaccharide generates a chiral (anomeric) center. A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center. The formation of α linkages or β linkages depends on the direction of the C-1 hydroxyl group with respect to the plane of the ring. The most common monosaccharides are the hexoses. Modifications include the absence of one or more oxygen atoms (deoxysugars), oxidation of a primary hydroxyl group to a carboxylic acid (uronic acid), or replacement of a hydroxyl group with a primary amine or acylamino-group. Each of these monosaccharides exists in a number of isomeric forms because of the constituent asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. Glycosylation is the process by which one or more monosaccharide or oligosaccharide units are linked to proteins or lipids. It is the most common post-translational modification (PTM) [5]. The central paradigm of modern molecular biology is that the information flows from DNA to RNA to protein to cell. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms and nearly half of them are glycosylated . The central paradigm of modern molecular biology is that the information flows from DNA to RNA to protein to cell. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms and nearly half of them are glycosylated [6]. When linked to a specific site on a protein backbone, glycans can modify the structural properties of the protein, affecting its solubility and conformation. Glycans are also important in localization and cellular adhesion events such as those occurring during development and tumorigenesis . When linked to a specific site on a protein backbone, glycans can modify the structural properties of the protein, affecting its solubility and conformation. Glycans are also important in localization and cellular adhesion events such as those occurring during development and tumorigenesis [7][8][9][10]. The modification modulates the activity of the molecules decorated. For example, changes in glycosylation on the cellular surface cause the immune system to target infected cells for destruction.. The modification modulates the activity of the molecules decorated. For example, changes in glycosylation on the cellular surface cause the immune system to target infected cells for destruction.\\nGlycoproteins often exist as heterogeneous mixtures of closely related structures, called glycoforms, which vary in their glycan structures and glycan attachment sites. Glycans attached to specific sites on a protein backbone generate structurally and chemically diverse glycoproteins. The two most common forms of glycosylation are N-and O-linked glycosylation (Figure 1). In N-glycosylation, oligosaccharides bind to the amine nitrogen of asparagine side chains within the Asn-Xxx-Ser(Thr) consensus sequence in which Xxx is any amino acid except proline. In O-glycosylation, oligosaccharides are linked to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine (Ser) or Threonine (Thr) side chains. The N-glycans of higher organisms all contain a common pentasaccharide core structure (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ), which is also called trimannosyl chitobiose core ). In N-glycosylation, oligosaccharides bind to the amine nitrogen of asparagine side chains within the Asn-Xxx-Ser(Thr) consensus sequence in which Xxx is any amino acid except proline. In O-glycosylation, oligosaccharides are linked to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine (Ser) or Threonine (Thr) side chains. The N-glycans of higher organisms all contain a common pentasaccharide core structure (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ), which is also called trimannosyl chitobiose core [11]; in contrast, multiple O-glycan core structures exist, and there is considerable structural diversity in this glycan class ; in contrast, multiple O-glycan core structures exist, and there is considerable structural diversity in this glycan class [12]..\\nIn eukaryotes, the glycoprotein and N-linked glycans are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, involving enzymes that first accomplish synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor [13]. The process begins with the step-wise addition of monosaccharide residues by oligotransferases, leading to a 14-oligosaccharide core on the lipid carrier dolicholpyrophosphate (Dol-P). Once the seven-sugar precursor (Man 5 GlcNAc 2 -PP-dolichol) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, the whole complex is flipped across the membrane layer into the ER lumen, where four more mannose residues and three glucose residues are added. In a co-translational process, the assembled glycan is transferred to Asn residues on the nascent protein, within Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons via the action of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Figure .

Figure 2 depicts the whole process  depicts the whole process [14]. High-mannose N-glycans contain only mannose attached to the chitobiose core. During passage through the ER and Golgi, the mannoses on antennae are removed and other types of residues are added, thus reaching the complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are incompletely processed and retain at least one antenna containing mannose residues . High-mannose N-glycans contain only mannose attached to the chitobiose core. During passage through the ER and Golgi, the mannoses on antennae are removed and other types of residues are added, thus reaching the complex N-glycans.

Glycoproteins will not pass ER quality control if they fail to reach the correct conformation . Glycoproteins will not pass ER quality control if they fail to reach the correct conformation [18]..\\nBy comparison, O-glycans have neither consensus sequence nor a consistent core structure; they are extremely diverse [19]. The process is typically initiated by adding a single Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue via glycosyltransferase . The process is typically initiated by adding a single Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue via glycosyltransferase [20]. Mammals have eight common O-glycan core structures .

O-Glycosylation also has significant effects on the solubility, conformation, stability and hydrophilicity of proteins [21]..\\nThe study of glycans, termed glycomics, is applied to biology and chemistry that focuses on the structure and function of carbohydrates, and on glycoform distributions at the cellular, tissue, organ and organism levels. A glycomics approach may combine three main aspects: the structural characterization of glycans, detailed understanding of glycan-protein interactions, and the study of in vitro and in vivo systems for the determination of function of specific glycans. This review focuses on the structural identification of glycans and determination of glycoform patterns, and summarizes recent techniques in mass spectrometric glycomics. Despite the important functions of oligosaccharides in biological systems, structural determination of these molecules is an analytical challenge compared to other biomolecules. Unlike linear peptides or nucleic acids, a very limited number of monosaccharides can form many stereoisomeric structures of carbohydrates. For structural elucidation, not only the monosaccharides (and their stereochemistry) need be identified, but also how they link together to form the polymers needs to be determined, which may include their sequence and branching pattern. Glycoform patterns and their changes may be measured at the semiquantitative or quantitative level; usually the values are expressed as relative rather than absolute changes. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the important tools for the structural characterization of carbohydrates, as it offers high sensitivity and addresses the most frequent biological problems. With the help of chromatographic separation, derivatization and mass spectral fragmentation, oligosaccharide structures can be elucidated.\\n\\nThe general approach for analyzing carbohydrates involves, first, the release of the glycan moiety from the glycoprotein. Two general methods are available for releasing carbohydrates: enzymatic methods and chemical methods. Enzymatic methods offer the advantage of preserving the information of the glycoprotein. The glycoprotein will not be degraded so that remains available for analysis. Specific enzymes are used to release Nlinked glycans from glycoproteins. Two types of enzymes are available, endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases; the former releases all or most of the glycan whereas the latter removes only a very specific portion of the non-reducing end of the glycan. Common endoglycosidases are the PNGase family which are amidases that release most N-glycans, e.g., PNGase F cleaves the bond between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagines residues of glycoproteins, releasing the carbohydrate and preserving the intact glycosylamine at the reducing end [22,23], although the amino group is quickly hydrolyzed and replaced by an hydroxyl group. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) cleaves between the GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose core for high mannose and hybrid glycans , although the amino group is quickly hydrolyzed and replaced by an hydroxyl group. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) cleaves between the GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose core for high mannose and hybrid glycans [24]. Exoglycosidases cleave one monosaccharide unit at a time from the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate chain and are frequently employed stepwise in conjunction with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) profiling of glycoforms, to facilitate assignment of the terminal monosaccharides and linkages . Exoglycosidases cleave one monosaccharide unit at a time from the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate chain and are frequently employed stepwise in conjunction with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) profiling of glycoforms, to facilitate assignment of the terminal monosaccharides and linkages [37]. Therefore, many features in the structure of the carbohydrate sample might be deduced from the enzymatic reaction(s). However, not all features of the sequences and linkages can be defined solely by using this approach. Hence, linkage analysis experiments that employ Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) are still necessary and are regularly employed for rigorous structure analysis..

However, not all features of the sequences and linkages can be defined solely by using this approach. Hence, linkage analysis experiments that employ Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) are still necessary and are regularly employed for rigorous structure analysis.\\nChemical release, which includes alkaline elimination and hydrazinolysis [25][26][27], preserves the carbohydrate moiety but degrades the glycoprotein. It is frequently used to release Olinked glycans from glycoproteins, since there is a dearth of glycosidases for release of Olinked glycans., preserves the carbohydrate moiety but degrades the glycoprotein. It is frequently used to release Olinked glycans from glycoproteins, since there is a dearth of glycosidases for release of Olinked glycans.\\nIn order to retain the information about site occupancy, N-linked glycan release may be carried out in the presence of 18 O-water, or an enzyme such as PNGase F1-F3 or endo H, that leave the first GlcNAc attached to the protein, may be employed. The determination of glycoform distributions at specific positions on the protein(s) requires that the sample be subjected to proteolysis and analyzed at the glycopeptide level, usually with on-or off-line chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry, or that the glycans be characterized after release from isolated glycopeptides.\\n\\nReleased sugars contain a single reactive carbonyl group at the reducing end that can be derivatized separately from the other hydroxyl groups. This property has been used to improve ionization, to add a stable isotope tag or to attach a chromophore for detection by High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) [28,29]. Reductive amination works for N-linked glycans released enzymatically from proteins and for any glycan that contains a reducing end. It is not applicable to O-glycans released under reductive conditions, while the aldehyde group is reduced to an alditol, but this group may also be derivatized efficiently or labelled with stable isotopes for structural or quantitative studies..

It is not applicable to O-glycans released under reductive conditions, while the aldehyde group is reduced to an alditol, but this group may also be derivatized efficiently or labelled with stable isotopes for structural or quantitative studies.\\nPermethylation is another important derivatization tool for investigation of glycan structures [30,31]. Carbohydrates are not ionized as efficiently as compounds such as proteins that can be protonated on many basic sites, neither do they appear to be transferred to the vapor phase as efficiently. Permethylation decreases the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the sample volatility and thus the intensity of the ion signals .

Furthermore, it can eliminate the negative charge associated with acidic residues, and thus stabilize acidic residues in the positive mode; this feature is especially important for the analysis of sialylated glycans in which the carboxyl group is located on the same carbon as the glycosidic linkage . Furthermore, it can eliminate the negative charge associated with acidic residues, and thus stabilize acidic residues in the positive mode; this feature is especially important for the analysis of sialylated glycans in which the carboxyl group is located on the same carbon as the glycosidic linkage [35]. The reaction pathways for reductive amination and permethylation are shown in Figure . The reaction pathways for reductive amination and permethylation are shown in Figure 3, also with several commonly used reagents for reductive amination , also with several commonly used reagents for reductive amination [36,37]..\\n\\nAfter release of the carbohydrates, the next stage is separation of the carbohydrates. This is not always necessary but it offers the advantage of reducing sample complexity, especially when dealing with biological samples. In most cases, the large variety of isomeric or closely related structures of carbohydrate moiety requires high performance separation techniques prior to mass spectrometry.\\nBoth native glycans and permethylated glycans can be separated by HPLC with a C 18 column. As noted above, reductive amination adds chromophores to native glycans, allowing the detection by Ultraviolet (UV) when using offline HPLC. Normal phase LC provides such regular separation of glycans (usually analyzed as derivatives with a chromophore at the reducing end) that the retention index scale is quite linear and can be used as a basis for assignments [38]. The combination of HPLC and MS (online HPLC) provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of native glycans, dramatically decreasing the effort and time requirements .

Both offline and online liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) approaches are used for glycan or glycoconjugate profiling.

When permethylation is applied to increase the hydrophobicity, glycans can be separated by reversed phase LC [42]..\\nPorous graphitized carbon chromatography (PGC) uses a solid phase that is composed of large macromolecules that are made up primarily of carbon atoms. There are two main mechanisms which may contribute to retention: hydrophobic interactions and electronic forces [43]. PGC shows an extraordinary isomeric selectivity to separate glycan isomers .

However, it cannot separate isomers.\\nIon mobility -mass spectrometry is an emerging method to distinguish isomers of glycans. IM-MS separates and identifies ionized molecules in the gas phase based on their mobility in the presence of a carrier buffer gas. In IMS-MS, a weak uniform electric field is applied across a drift tube to pull ions through the buffer gas. Compact isomers with higher mobility exit the drift tube earlier than those with lower mobility [48]. Recently, advances in the development of traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) have significantly increased sensitivity and speed .

Isomers of Man 7 GlcNAc 2 can be separated by the technique. IM-MS reduces the carbohydrate complexity in a given mass window. Use of tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with IM-MS can obtain much \"clearer\" fragmentation ions based on separated precursor ions compared to those previously detected in the mixture caused by overlap between isotopic distributions of their precursors .

This will simplify the level of glycoform de novo identifications by mass spectrometry and make results much more definitive. The development of this and other mobility-based approaches is an especially active area of current MS research and development..

The development of this and other mobility-based approaches is an especially active area of current MS research and development.\\n\\nMass spectrometry (MS), in its most simple definition, is the production and detection of ions separated according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The detection of such ions results in a mass spectrum which is a plot of the relative abundance of the ions as a function of their m/z ratio. At present, the two most widely-used MS ionization techniques for the analysis of carbohydrates are Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) and Electrospray Ionization (ESI); in both free glycans are typically detected as metal (usually sodium) adducts in the positive ion mode, and as deprotonated or anion-adducted species in the negative-ion mode. Glycopeptides may be detected in their protonated or deprotonated forms. Both MALDI and ESI are soft ionization techniques; i.e., the ionization process imparts little excess energy and thus generates few or no fragments for glycans so that the intact molecular ions can be easily observed. Nevertheless, prompt loss of labile groups, especially sialic acid and fucose, may occur and the extent of its occurrence should be assessed, particularly in quantitative studies. Both MALDI-MS and ESI-MS can be applied to obtain an overall glycan profile. MALDI yields a series of singly charged molecular ions and the ionization efficiency for neutral carbohydrates is constant as the size of molecule increases, in contrast to that for ESI, where the ionization efficiency decreases with an increasing molecular weight [54]. Additionally, ESI usually generates multiply charged ions; although these complicate spectral analysis, especially when mixtures are introduced with on-or off-line separation, the instrument software can perform a deconvolution of the multiple charge states to produce a spectrum that shows a single molecular weight distribution. However, the signal is distributed over multiple charge states and this affects the ability to detect low-abundance species..

Lipids M2 and M3 may result from fragmentation of the ion M1 or may represent variant products that arise from differences in the biosynthetic pathways.\\nAlthough MALDI-MS and ESI-MS spectra are highly suited to mass fingerprinting of glycan mixtures and is thus very valuable for initial stages of glycomic analysis, the lack of fragment ions can be a problem for detailed structural elucidation of glycans. This can be solved by making the molecular ions more energetic thereby inducing fragmentation, which is achieved by employing one or more well-controlled dissociation steps and tandem mass spectrometry.\\nTandem mass spectrometry (MS n ), including low-and high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) [56][57][58], infrared multiphoton dissociation , infrared multiphoton dissociation [59] and the newer electronbased dissociation methods  and the newer electronbased dissociation methods [60][61][62][63][64] has proven to be a powerful means for carbohydrate structural identification. Generally, glycans undergo two main types of cleavage upon CID: glycosidic cleavages resulting from the rupture between the two neighboring residues and cross-ring cleavages that involve the fragmentation of a sugar ring. The former provide information on composition and sequence, while the latter provide some details on the different linkage types. Internal fragments are generated upon the occurrence of two (or more) cleavages, either glycosidic or cross-ring, from more than one site in the molecule  has proven to be a powerful means for carbohydrate structural identification.

Adamson et al. and Zhao et al. have investigated the application of electron capture dissociation (ECD) to both linear and branched oligosaccharides by utilizing FT-ICR mass spectrometers [63,64]. They showed that cross-ring cleavages were the dominant fragmentation pathway in ECD spectra. Whereas ECD is applied in the positive ion mode for characterization of neutral glycans, electron detachment dissociation (EDD) generates fragmentation in the negative mode for analysis of acidic glycans, and has been shown to be particularly useful for analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

However, due to the inadequate interaction with tissue, they may cause foreign body reaction. Moreover, surface induced thrombosis can occur when biomaterials are used for blood containing applications. Surface modification of the biomaterials can bring enhanced surface properties in biomedical applications. Sulfated polysaccharide coatings can be used to avoid surface induced thrombosis which may cause vascular occlusion (blocking the blood flow by blood clot), which results in serious health problems. Naturally occurring heparin is one of the sulfated polysaccharides most commonly used as an anticoagulant, but its long term usage causes hemorrhage. Marine sourced sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan is an alternative anticoagulant without the hemorrhage drawback. Heparin and fucoidan immobilization onto a low density polyethylene surface after functionalization by plasma has been studied. Surface energy was demonstrated by water contact angle test and chemical characterizations were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface morphology was monitored by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. Finally, their anticoagulation activity was examined for prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).\\n\\nBiocompatibility of polymeric biomaterials can be considered mostly by means of their bulk and surface properties. Mechanical compatibility is important for sufficient stability and appropriate rigidity within bulk properties, whereas material surface compatibility is important to obtain a good interfacial biocompatibility. When a biomaterial is placed into the body, firstly its surface comes into contact with physiological fluids, thus the first interaction is strongly dependent on the surface properties.\\nWhen a synthetic biomaterial, with the purpose of implantation or tissue replacement, is introduced into a living biological system it can cause a foreign body reaction and surface induced thrombosis since it is not biologically active as living tissues. The first response of the biological system is the rapid protein adsorption (within seconds) onto a biomaterial's surface, in accordance with the Vroman Effect [1,2]. As such, this response becomes recognizable by the integrin receptors of most of the cells . As such, this response becomes recognizable by the integrin receptors of most of the cells [3]. Thus, cellular interaction with the adsorbed protein layer plays a paramount importance . Thus, cellular interaction with the adsorbed protein layer plays a paramount importance [3][4][5][6][7]. The type, concentration, and conformation of the proteins are important by means of further cellular interactions at the interface . The type, concentration, and conformation of the proteins are important by means of further cellular interactions at the interface [2]..\\nIn terms of blood compatibility, the blood response strongly depends on materials' surface properties, such as surface chemistry, energy, charge density, and wettability [4]. Protein adsorption is followed by platelet adhesion and aggregation, activation of intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation via blood protein factor XII (mostly activated by negatively charged surfaces . Protein adsorption is followed by platelet adhesion and aggregation, activation of intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation via blood protein factor XII (mostly activated by negatively charged surfaces [8]), fibrin network formation, complement system activation with interactions of erythrocytes and leucocytes ), fibrin network formation, complement system activation with interactions of erythrocytes and leucocytes [3,5,[9][10][11][12]. Therefore, this coagulation cascade triggers the thrombus (blood clot) formation on the biomaterials' surface, namely surface induced thrombosis . Therefore, this coagulation cascade triggers the thrombus (blood clot) formation on the biomaterials' surface, namely surface induced thrombosis [4,5], which may cause blood vessel occlusion or heart attack in the case of its vascular implantation , which may cause blood vessel occlusion or heart attack in the case of its vascular implantation [13,14]. Thus, reducing protein adsorption and platelet activity increase the hemocompatibility of the biomaterial.. Thus, reducing protein adsorption and platelet activity increase the hemocompatibility of the biomaterial.\\nSome of the polymeric materials (such as polyolefins) have low surface energy and lack adequate enough bonding interfaces which makes them challenging substrates for further surface modification; as such, surface treatment is essential [15,16]. Functionalization of biomaterials by means of surface treatment is possible by several methods, such as corona discharge, UV irradiation, wet chemistry, flame treatment, ozone induced treatment, flame treatment, and plasma treatment . Functionalization of biomaterials by means of surface treatment is possible by several methods, such as corona discharge, UV irradiation, wet chemistry, flame treatment, ozone induced treatment, flame treatment, and plasma treatment [17][18][19]. Among them, plasma treatment is an effective way to modify polymer surface homogeneously without toxic residues. The heat free process of plasma treatment is another important advantage, especially for heat sensitive polymeric materials, in order to keep their desired bulk properties. Altering the plasma parameters, such as diversity of used gas with its flow rate, reactor type and pressure, generated power, and frequency creates different types of plasma for individual applications like sterilization, deposition, chain scission, ion etching, cross-linking, polymerization, surface activation, etc. .

Controlling the process efficiency is possible by changing the exposure time. Plasma treatment can introduce oxygen containing functional groups (such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl) onto the polymer surface by means of excited atoms, ions, electrons, neutral species, and ultraviolet light; in doing so, polymer surfaces can become more convenient for further chemical modifications .

Plasma treatment can introduce oxygen containing functional groups (such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl) onto the polymer surface by means of excited atoms, ions, electrons, neutral species, and ultraviolet light; in doing so, polymer surfaces can become more convenient for further chemical modifications [17,[21][22][23]..\\nTo avoid blood coagulation, fibrinolysis occurs by a normal body process [24] as a result of the breakdown of blood clots (primary fibrinolysis) or by medical supply (secondary fibrinolysis). Thrombus inhibition by anticoagulant fucoidan is a promising strategy to avoid thrombus formation. Heparin is another polysaccharide (see Figure  as a result of the breakdown of blood clots (primary fibrinolysis) or by medical supply (secondary fibrinolysis). Thrombus inhibition by anticoagulant fucoidan is a promising strategy to avoid thrombus formation. Heparin is another polysaccharide (see Figure 1a) that has been used as an anticoagulant for several years ) that has been used as an anticoagulant for several years [15,25,26]. The biggest drawback of heparin is hemorrhaging and thrombocytopenia . The biggest drawback of heparin is hemorrhaging and thrombocytopenia [25][26][27]. It may also cause virus-based infections due to the fact that it is mostly obtained from animals [25]. Fucoidan is another sulfated polysaccharide that has attracted scientific interest in recent years as an alternative anticoagulant to heparin. Fucoidan is a marine sourced biopolymer largely found in the intercellular matrix of brown algae [25] and rather limitedly found in marine invertebrates . It may also cause virus-based infections due to the fact that it is mostly obtained from animals [25]. Fucoidan is another sulfated polysaccharide that has attracted scientific interest in recent years as an alternative anticoagulant to heparin. Fucoidan is a marine sourced biopolymer largely found in the intercellular matrix of brown algae [25] and rather limitedly found in marine invertebrates [27][28][29][30] (see Figure  (see Figure 1b). Besides its anticoagulant activity, it has an assortment of biological activities, such as antivirus, anticancer, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. These properties make fucoidan an attractive polysaccharide for numerous biomedical applications ). Besides its anticoagulant activity, it has an assortment of biological activities, such as antivirus, anticancer, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. These properties make fucoidan an attractive polysaccharide for numerous biomedical applications [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]..\\nDissimilarly to other polysaccharides, the mechanism of anticoagulant activity of fucoidan is related to the interactions with the natural thrombin inhibitors of antithrombin (AT III) and heparin cofactor II (HCII), activated factor II (thrombin), and activated factor X [26,28,36,37]. The effect of the anticoagulant activity of fucoidan depends on its structural properties, such as sulfation pattern and degree, monosaccharide composition and especially its molecular weight (MW) . The effect of the anticoagulant activity of fucoidan depends on its structural properties, such as sulfation pattern and degree, monosaccharide composition and especially its molecular weight (MW) [27,28,36,38]. For instance, low molecular weight (LMW) fucoidan has been found to be effective for its anti-inflammatory response, while middle and high molecular weight fucoidan has been found to be more effective for its anticoagulant activity, which is related to the altering of sulfate groups by changing MW in order to control the binding properties .

Besides the drawbacks of heparin, it has been found that the anticoagulant activity of fucoidan is greater than heparin . Besides the drawbacks of heparin, it has been found that the anticoagulant activity of fucoidan is greater than heparin [39]. On the other hand, the structure of fucoidan is not well defined yet, so as such its applications are presently rather limited.. On the other hand, the structure of fucoidan is not well defined yet, so as such its applications are presently rather limited.\\nIn this study, low density polyethylene (LDPE) was used as a substrate to functionalize its surface by means of plasma treatment and further polymerization by grafting polymer brushes of Allylamine (AAM), N-allylmethylamine (MAAM), and N,N-dimethylallylamine (DAAM) by introducing an amine functional group, one methyl, and two methyl groups to reveal the optimum polymer brush for the immobilization of the anticoagulants heparin and fucoidan. Surface characterizations were carried out by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and wettability test. Anticoagulation activity was examined for prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).\\n\\nDue to the similar and unsatisfying anticoagulation behaviors of AAM, MAAM, and DAAM immobilized samples, their investigations, except the anticoagulation test, are not placed in this paper. In fact, as was observed after surface examinations, the existence of their polymer brushes was revealed, however, they did not show any significant effect on further heparin/fucoidan immobilization.\\n\\nSurface wettability was carried out by static contact angle measurement by sessile drop technique using distilled water as a testing liquid; results are provided in Table 1. Changes in the water contact angle (θ w ) by spreading the water on the surface, as a result of bonding interactions of the water molecules, refers to hydrophilicity, which has a correlation with its surface energy. The water contact angle of the reference polyethylene (PE) is drastically decreased by about 33% after plasma treatment (from 85.3 ˝to 56.9 ˝) as a result of the presence of plasma induced hydrophilic oxidative functional groups . Changes in the water contact angle (θ w ) by spreading the water on the surface, as a result of bonding interactions of the water molecules, refers to hydrophilicity, which has a correlation with its surface energy. The water contact angle of the reference polyethylene (PE) is drastically decreased by about 33% after plasma treatment (from 85.3 ˝to 56.9 ˝) as a result of the presence of plasma induced hydrophilic oxidative functional groups [40] and also with respect to the surface roughening which is discussed in Section 2.3. Thus, wettability and surface energy is increased and therefore the PET surface becomes more likely to interact with further modifications. It has also been known that such hydrophilic surfaces have significant influence on the cell and blood plasma protein interactions. Heparin and fucoidan immobilized samples before plasma treatment (PEH and PEF, respectively) and heparin immobilized sample after plasma treatment (PETH) showed almost the same wettability properties (Table  and also with respect to the surface roughening which is discussed in Section 2.3. Thus, wettability and surface energy is increased and therefore the PET surface becomes more likely to interact with further modifications. It has also been known that such hydrophilic surfaces have significant influence on the cell and blood plasma protein interactions. Heparin and fucoidan immobilized samples before plasma treatment (PEH and PEF, respectively) and heparin immobilized sample after plasma treatment (PETH) showed almost the same wettability properties (Table 1) due to insufficient immobilization of anticoagulants (see Section 2.2). The fucoidan immobilized sample after plasma treatment (PETF) showed the lowest water contact angle value among all anticoagulant immobilized samples, which corresponds to its hydrophilic character (Table ) due to insufficient immobilization of anticoagulants (see Section 2.2). The fucoidan immobilized sample after plasma treatment (PETF) showed the lowest water contact angle value among all anticoagulant immobilized samples, which corresponds to its hydrophilic character (Table 1). This indicates that fucoidan was successfully immobilized onto the surface, which was also demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy.). This indicates that fucoidan was successfully immobilized onto the surface, which was also demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy.\\n\\nSurface morphological images of the samples taken by SEM are shown in Figure 2. The reference PE sample exhibits homogenous, relatively smooth surface morphology with a minor uniform fiber-like feature stem from the production (Figure . The reference PE sample exhibits homogenous, relatively smooth surface morphology with a minor uniform fiber-like feature stem from the production (Figure 2a). After plasma treatment, the surface morphology became rougher due to the surface reorganization by exposition in plasma (Figure ). After plasma treatment, the surface morphology became rougher due to the surface reorganization by exposition in plasma (Figure 2b). As a result, increased surface area was generated by increasing roughness, which is a desired surface condition for further interactions. Without plasma treatment the immobilization of the anticoagulants onto PE surface were limited since partially attachment was observed (see Figure ). As a result, increased surface area was generated by increasing roughness, which is a desired surface condition for further interactions. Without plasma treatment the immobilization of the anticoagulants onto PE surface were limited since partially attachment was observed (see Figure 2c,d). Therefore, beside immobilized anticoagulants, blood may also contact with the substrate, which results in decrease of antithrombotic effect. Plasma modified samples (Figure ). Therefore, beside immobilized anticoagulants, blood may also contact with the substrate, which results in decrease of antithrombotic effect. Plasma modified samples (Figure 2e,f) exhibit more homogenous and completely coated layers thanks to the functional groups introduced by plasma treatment. In addition to the antithrombotic activities of anticoagulants, the bonding type is also crucial for further interactions with the blood, which is discussed in Section 2.6 in this paper. ) exhibit more homogenous and completely coated layers thanks to the functional groups introduced by plasma treatment. In addition to the antithrombotic activities of anticoagulants, the bonding type is also crucial for further interactions with the blood, which is discussed in Section 2.6 in this paper.\\n\\nSurface topography investigations of the samples were carried out by AFM; the corresponding images are shown in Figure 3. The surface roughness of the reference PE sample is rather smooth with an average roughness value of 24.2 nm (Table . The surface roughness of the reference PE sample is rather smooth with an average roughness value of 24.2 nm (Table 1). Direct immobilizations of the anticoagulants heparin and fucoidan onto the PE surface decreased the surface roughness to 13.9 and 20.3 nm, respectively (Figure ). Direct immobilizations of the anticoagulants heparin and fucoidan onto the PE surface decreased the surface roughness to 13.9 and 20.3 nm, respectively (Figure 3c,d). This indicates that heparin and fucoidan particles slightly covered the pores of the PE with a non-uniform feature. However, the PE surface became more rough (46.7 nm) after plasma treatment by etching of the surface (Figure ). This indicates that heparin and fucoidan particles slightly covered the pores of the PE with a non-uniform feature. However, the PE surface became more rough (46.7 nm) after plasma treatment by etching of the surface (Figure 3b). Similar behavior was observed after the heparin and fucoidan immobilization for PETH and PETF samples in that the layers of anticoagulants decreased the roughness of PET to 17.9 and 24 nm, respectively. The roughness of the PETH and PETF is slightly higher than their PEH and PEF counterparts, which indicates the effect of plasma treatment. It should be emphasized that roughness value itself is not an indicator of the uniformity of the coated layer, and that features of the immobilized anticoagulants should also be take into consideration.).

It should be emphasized that roughness value itself is not an indicator of the uniformity of the coated layer, and that features of the immobilized anticoagulants should also be take into consideration.\\nMoreover, although the reference PE and PETF show similar surface roughness values, their wettability behaviors are completely different, as was discussed previously in Section 2.1. Therefore, it is evident that wettability, even in the same roughness conditions, is also related to chemical features of the examined substrates. Roughness is an important feature by means of contact area for cell and blood protein adhesion.\\n\\nFigure 4 shows chemical changes in the near-surface area of the selected samples obtained by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra. Regarding the spectrum of the PE, main peaks at the wavenumbers of 2915 and 2850 cm ´1, which are ascribed to C-H stretching, are visible (typical for aliphatic hydrocarbon chain)  shows chemical changes in the near-surface area of the selected samples obtained by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra. Regarding the spectrum of the PE, main peaks at the wavenumbers of 2915 and 2850 cm ´1, which are ascribed to C-H stretching, are visible (typical for aliphatic hydrocarbon chain) [41]. Characteristic signals of C-H bending deformation and methylene rocking deformation appeared at the wavenumbers of 1470 and 719 cm ´1, respectively. By means of the PET sample, in addition to PE peaks, amine groups introduced by plasma treatment are clearly seen at the wavenumber of 1630 cm ´1 and oxygen containing hydroperoxides are apparent at the wavenumber of 3370 cm ´1 . Characteristic signals of C-H bending deformation and methylene rocking deformation appeared at the wavenumbers of 1470 and 719 cm ´1, respectively. By means of the PET sample, in addition to PE peaks, amine groups introduced by plasma treatment are clearly seen at the wavenumber of 1630 cm ´1 and oxygen containing hydroperoxides are apparent at the wavenumber of 3370 cm ´1 [21]. PEH and PEF spectra did not show significant changes to the peaks in comparison to the PET peaks (which means that the peaks at the 3370 and 1630 cm ´1 are still visible), which serves as evidence for the limited immobilization (or no immobilization at all, but some seen on SEM images) of the heparin and fucoidan on the PE surface without plasma treatment. In the case of PETH and PETF samples, hydroperoxide and amine group peaks are not visible anymore, which serves as an indicator of heparin and fucoidan immobilization on the PE surface after plasma treatment. .

Samples without plasma treatment (PE, PEH, PEF) displayed the same carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur levels in regards to the XPS spectra, irrelevant of their exposure to anticoagulants. Constant carbon levels indicate that immobilization of heparin/fucoidan did not take place on the PE surface, or that it took place on a limited basis, since no apparent carbon consumption occurred by introducing of anticoagulants, as we have witnessed partially heparin/fucoidan layers on the surfaces by SEM in Figure .

As expected, the oxygen level is also constant, which means none of the oxide groups were introduced by plasma treatment yet, and the absence of nitrogen is evidence of free amine groups. After plasma treatment, the carbon level decreased by about 12% and the oxygen content significantly increased due to the introduced oxides groups; the appearance of a nitrogen level of 1.1% indicates the introduction of amine groups by the plasma treatment.. As expected, the oxygen level is also constant, which means none of the oxide groups were introduced by plasma treatment yet, and the absence of nitrogen is evidence of free amine groups. After plasma treatment, the carbon level decreased by about 12% and the oxygen content significantly increased due to the introduced oxides groups; the appearance of a nitrogen level of 1.1% indicates the introduction of amine groups by the plasma treatment.\\nAnticoagulant immobilization after plasma treatment, in the case of PETH and PETF, decreased the carbon and nitrogen level (amine groups) by chemical bonding and increased the oxygen content due to the oxide containing functional groups present in heparin and fucoidan. Besides consumption of carbon and nitrogen, existing pH levels are the most important evidence of the immobilization of anticoagulants. The immobilized fucoidan layer on the PET sample is greater than that of the immobilized heparin layer, in considering the pH levels (see Table 2). Therefore, it has a more significant impact on antithrombotic properties.). Therefore, it has a more significant impact on antithrombotic properties.\\n\\nThe blood coagulation cascade consists of the tissue-mediated extrinsic pathway, surface-mediated intrinsic pathway, and common coagulation pathway [42]. The examination of those coagulation pathways were carried out for all samples by means of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).. The examination of those coagulation pathways were carried out for all samples by means of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).\\nPT assay measures the clot formation time in both the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. The normal time range for healthy donors is generally between 11-13.5 s [41]. As summarized in Table . As summarized in Table 3, all samples are within this range., all samples are within this range.\\nAn aPTT assay is related to both the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. The normal time range of aPTT for healthy donors is between 25 and 32 s [43]. As summarized in Table . As summarized in Table 3, none of the samples performed anticoagulant activity on the intrinsic pathway since none of them prolonged aPTT, which indicates no remarkable inhibition of the intrinsic pathway factors. Although, some of the samples exhibited slightly lower aPTT values than the control value, it can be ignored since the differences were still under the physiological threshold., none of the samples performed anticoagulant activity on the intrinsic pathway since none of them prolonged aPTT, which indicates no remarkable inhibition of the intrinsic pathway factors. Although, some of the samples exhibited slightly lower aPTT values than the control value, it can be ignored since the differences were still under the physiological threshold.\\nTT is a measure of thrombin formation time by converting fibrinogen to fibrin in the common coagulation pathway [42]. The lower limit for TT to perform anticoagulation activity is 20 s . The lower limit for TT to perform anticoagulation activity is 20 s [43]. The TT of the control PE value (15.9 s) is comparable to the TT value of the plasma modified sample (PET); that indicates plasma induced oxidative functional groups and its increased hydrophilicity were not influencing TT, which is in contrast with the fact that hydrophilicity affects the coagulation cascade, but it is worth noting that pH values and the surface charges are another two crucial parameters to affect the coagulation cascade. Similar results were observed for AAM, MAAM, and DAAM grafted samples (PETA, PETM, and PETD, respectively) with their anticoagulant immobilized counterparts. Antithrombotic activity was not monitored (Table . The TT of the control PE value (15.9 s) is comparable to the TT value of the plasma modified sample (PET); that indicates plasma induced oxidative functional groups and its increased hydrophilicity were not influencing TT, which is in contrast with the fact that hydrophilicity affects the coagulation cascade, but it is worth noting that pH values and the surface charges are another two crucial parameters to affect the coagulation cascade. Similar results were observed for AAM, MAAM, and DAAM grafted samples (PETA, PETM, and PETD, respectively) with their anticoagulant immobilized counterparts. Antithrombotic activity was not monitored (Table 3) since intramolecular interactions between grafted polymer brushes and anticoagulants were not sufficient for immobilization, which is in agreement with the SEM investigations. Immobilizations of anticoagulants heparin and fucoidan without plasma treatment (PEH and PEF) did not affect TT due to insufficient immobilization, as was observed in Figure ) since intramolecular interactions between grafted polymer brushes and anticoagulants were not sufficient for immobilization, which is in agreement with the SEM investigations. Immobilizations of anticoagulants heparin and fucoidan without plasma treatment (PEH and PEF) did not affect TT due to insufficient immobilization, as was observed in Figure 4. This is consistent with the XPS results in that the PEH and PEF samples did not possess sulfur content in order to increase heparin cofactor II (HCII) based antithrombotic activity . This is consistent with the XPS results in that the PEH and PEF samples did not possess sulfur content in order to increase heparin cofactor II (HCII) based antithrombotic activity [25,39]. Due to the fact that sulfur content was observed only for heparin and fucoidan immobilized samples after plasma treatment (PETH and PETF), expected antithrombotic activity was observed only in the case of the PETF with a TT value of 20.9 s. First and foremost, its sulfur content was 2.4%, while PETH's was only 0.2%. Secondly, the fucoidan immobilization on the PET surface was sufficiently homogeneous in contrast to the heparin immobilized PETH sample, as was observed in Figure .

First and foremost, its sulfur content was 2.4%, while PETH's was only 0.2%. Secondly, the fucoidan immobilization on the PET surface was sufficiently homogeneous in contrast to the heparin immobilized PETH sample, as was observed in Figure 4, therefore its anticoagulation activity was increased; moreover, heparin is covalently bonded and did not interact sufficiently with the coagulation factors., therefore its anticoagulation activity was increased; moreover, heparin is covalently bonded and did not interact sufficiently with the coagulation factors.\\n\\nCylindrical, low density polyethylene (LDPE) Vacuette blood collection tubes (with 20 cm 2 of contacted surface area) and 4 mL of coagulation sodium citrate (3.2%) were purchased from Greiner Bio-One Company (Kremsmunster, Austria) to use for the anticoagulation activity observation. All blood collection tubes were thoroughly cleaned with distilled water and dried at 30 ˝C for 24 h in an oven. LDPE film with 100 µm thickness was used as a control substrate to LDPE blood collection tubes. The foil was cut into the form of square flat sheets with the dimension of 50 mm ˆ50 mm and was used as received without further purification. Both the sheet and tube form of prepared LDPE samples hereafter referred to as PE. Monomers (see Figure 5) of Allylamine (AAM), N-allylmethylamine (MAAM) with anticoagulants Fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus, and heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and N,N-dimethylallylamine (DAAM) was supplied by Fluka (St. Louis, MO, USA). Heparin and fucoidan solutions were prepared as 1% (w/v) in distilled water and placed in the vials for further use.  ) of Allylamine (AAM), N-allylmethylamine (MAAM) with anticoagulants Fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus, and heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and N,N-dimethylallylamine (DAAM) was supplied by Fluka (St. Louis, MO, USA). Heparin and fucoidan solutions were prepared as 1% (w/v) in distilled water and placed in the vials for further use.\\n\\nThe direct current (DC) plasma discharge used for all experiments was generated at the frequency of 40 kHz and power of 50 Watts using a PICO (Diener, Ebhausen, Germany) plasma reactor with a volume of 3 dm 3 . Air was used as a discharge gas with 20 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) flow rate and the pressure in the vacuum chamber was 50 Pa. Both sides of each of the PE sheets and each of the blood collection tubes were exposed to the generated non-thermal plasma for the duration of 60 s (hereafter referred to as PET) to create free radicals and metastable reactive species on the surface to act as initiators for further copolymerization reactions.\\nAfter exposing the plasma, the samples were taken out of the chamber and immediately subjected to AAM, MAAM, and DAAM vapors for 20 s in order to immobilize them via a radical graft polymerization process to create functional amine groups containing polymer brushes on the surface, as shown in Figure 5. These samples are hereafter referred to as PETA, PETM, and PETD, respectively. The monomer contact with the radical within its lifetime is of a paramount importance. In our case, we expect the reaction of the monomer with peroxy radicals which have lifetimes in the range of a few seconds . These samples are hereafter referred to as PETA, PETM, and PETD, respectively. The monomer contact with the radical within its lifetime is of a paramount importance. In our case, we expect the reaction of the monomer with peroxy radicals which have lifetimes in the range of a few seconds [44]..\\nEach PETA, PETM, and PETD substrate were separately placed into heparin/fucoidan containing solution vials and blood collection tubes had been filled up by the same solution and placed in the rotational shaker for 24 h at room temperature in order to immobilize the anticoagulants to the grafted polymer brushes by intramolecular interactions. After 24 h of reaction time, the substrates were taken out of the vials and gently cleaned in water, then distilled water, to eliminate non-immobilized heparin/fucoidan species. In the case of the cylindrical test samples, heparin/fucoidan solutions were poured out and then cleaned carefully by water and distilled water. H and F, which were added in as the last letter of the previous sample abbreviations stand for the heparin and fucoidan immobilized conditions, respectively.\\nFinally, all samples were dried for 2 h at room temperature. Blood collection tubes were used for anticoagulant activity tests and square flat sheets were used for further tests.\\n\\nThe sessile drop method was used to evaluate the total free surface energy of the samples. We used the so-called (SEE System) surface energy evaluation system (Advex Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) equipped with a CCD camera. Distilled water was used as the testing liquid at 22 ˝C and 60% relative humidity. The volume of the droplets for each experiment was 5 µL and the droplets were kept for 30 s in order to obtain an equilibrium state prior to the measurement. Ten separate readings were averaged to obtain the representative contact angle value in order to estimate the surface hydrophilicity.\\n\\nThe surface morphology of all samples was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a NANOSEM 450 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) performed at 5 kV. The instrument was equipped with a so-called low vacuum detector (LVD), and the measurement was performed in a water vapor environment under 90 Pa pressure with a spot size of 50 nm.\\n\\nSurface topology characteristics on the samples were obtained by atomic force microscope (AFM) using a Dimension Icon (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). All experiments were performed by peak force tapping mode using a ScanAsyst-Air Si/Nitride probe (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) with k = 0.4 N/m of spring constant value of the cantilever. A scanning area of 5 ˆ5 µm for each sample was investigated with a frequency of 1 Hz. Average surface roughness (R a ) values were analyzed by using NanoScope Analysis software.\\n\\nFor surface chemistry examination, in order to compare the changes in chemical compositions of the studied samples, a Nicolet iS5 (Thermo Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) single beam Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) equipped with iD5 attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was used. Spectra were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm ´1 with a resolution of 2 cm ´1 and 64 scans using a ZnSe crystal at an incident angle of 45 ˝.\\n\\nThe chemical composition of the surfaces was analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using TFA XPS (Physical Electronics, Chanhassen, MN, USA). The samples were exposed to X-rays over a 400 µm spot size with a monochromatic Al K α1,2 radiation at 1486.6 eV, under 6 ˆ10 ´8 Pa chamber pressure. The emitted photoelectrons were detected with a hemispherical analyzer placed at an angle of 45 ˝in order to correlate to the normal plane of the samples. Survey-scan spectra were made with a 0.4 eV step resolution at 187.85 eV of pass energy. Surface neutralization was carried out by an electron gun, and MultiPak (Version 7.3.1) software (Physical Electronics, Chanhassen, MN, USA) was used to analyze elemental concentration.\\n\\nFor anticoagulation tests, the blood was obtained by venous puncture from a healthy donor in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and was placed into blood collection tubes (5 mL each). The obtained human blood plasma was treated with 3.2% citric acid (109 mmol/L) and then centrifuged at 3000ˆg for 15 min at room temperature. Anticoagulant activity was determined by means of prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) using a SYSMEXCA-1500 (Siemens, Munich, Germany) instrument. Each of the samples was examined three times.\\n\\nPlasma treatment onto LDPE and its effect on further anticoagulant heparin and fucoidan immobilizations has been studied. Surface wettability remarkably increased as a result of the introduced oxidative functional groups by plasma treatment and surface roughness increased by simultaneous etching, as was revealed by both the contact angle measurement and AFM. Anticoagulant immobilization on the LDPE surface without plasma treatment was not sufficient, as it observed from SEM images and XPS results, but treated surfaces showed more homogeneous layers and sulfur content; notably, fucoidan immobilization was more successful than heparin. Anticoagulation tests revealed that the PETF sample has anticoagulation effects, as evidenced by its more homogeneous immobilization and also the higher anticoagulation effect of fucoidan in comparison to heparin. Hence, surface modification of LDPE by plasma treatment followed by fucoidan immobilization represents an effective route to prevent surface mediated thrombus formations of blood contacting biomaterial.\\n\\n\", 'requirements': {'qar_num': 5}}\n"

We survey here the major biosynthetic pathways that underlie the biological diversity in glycobiology, with emphasis on glycoproteins, and the approaches that can be used to address the resulting heterogeneity. Included among these are derivatizations, on-and off-line chromatography, electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and a variety of dissociation methods, the recently introduced electronbased techniques being of particular interest.\\n\\nCarbohydrates are the most abundant and structurally diverse compounds found in nature. They participate in various biological processes. They are involved in diverse roles such as molecular recognition, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, energy generation, and modification of protein conformations. Carbohydrates also serve as markers for many disease states. They can be used in the food, textile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Increasing evidence shows that numerous biological functions are closely related to specific carbohydrate structures [1][2][3][4]. They can form branched structures because linkages of the constituent monosaccharides can occur at a number of positions.. They can form branched structures because linkages of the constituent monosaccharides can occur at a number of positions.\\nMonosaccharides, which cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form, are the most basic units of carbohydrates. Monosaccharides constitute oligosaccharides (2-10 units) by the attachment to one another via glycosidic linkages, forming branched or linear chains. Polysaccharides (>10 units) are typically reserved as large glycans that are composed of repeating oligosaccharide motifs. The ring form of a monosaccharide generates a chiral (anomeric) center. A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center. The formation of α linkages or β linkages depends on the direction of the C-1 hydroxyl group with respect to the plane of the ring. The most common monosaccharides are the hexoses. Modifications include the absence of one or more oxygen atoms (deoxysugars), oxidation of a primary hydroxyl group to a carboxylic acid (uronic acid), or replacement of a hydroxyl group with a primary amine or acylamino-group. Each of these monosaccharides exists in a number of isomeric forms because of the constituent asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. Glycosylation is the process by which one or more monosaccharide or oligosaccharide units are linked to proteins or lipids. It is the most common post-translational modification (PTM) [5]. The central paradigm of modern molecular biology is that the information flows from DNA to RNA to protein to cell. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms and nearly half of them are glycosylated . The central paradigm of modern molecular biology is that the information flows from DNA to RNA to protein to cell. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms and nearly half of them are glycosylated [6]. When linked to a specific site on a protein backbone, glycans can modify the structural properties of the protein, affecting its solubility and conformation. Glycans are also important in localization and cellular adhesion events such as those occurring during development and tumorigenesis . When linked to a specific site on a protein backbone, glycans can modify the structural properties of the protein, affecting its solubility and conformation. Glycans are also important in localization and cellular adhesion events such as those occurring during development and tumorigenesis [7][8][9][10]. The modification modulates the activity of the molecules decorated. For example, changes in glycosylation on the cellular surface cause the immune system to target infected cells for destruction.. The modification modulates the activity of the molecules decorated. For example, changes in glycosylation on the cellular surface cause the immune system to target infected cells for destruction.\\nGlycoproteins often exist as heterogeneous mixtures of closely related structures, called glycoforms, which vary in their glycan structures and glycan attachment sites. Glycans attached to specific sites on a protein backbone generate structurally and chemically diverse glycoproteins. The two most common forms of glycosylation are N-and O-linked glycosylation (Figure 1). In N-glycosylation, oligosaccharides bind to the amine nitrogen of asparagine side chains within the Asn-Xxx-Ser(Thr) consensus sequence in which Xxx is any amino acid except proline. In O-glycosylation, oligosaccharides are linked to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine (Ser) or Threonine (Thr) side chains. The N-glycans of higher organisms all contain a common pentasaccharide core structure (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ), which is also called trimannosyl chitobiose core ). In N-glycosylation, oligosaccharides bind to the amine nitrogen of asparagine side chains within the Asn-Xxx-Ser(Thr) consensus sequence in which Xxx is any amino acid except proline. In O-glycosylation, oligosaccharides are linked to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine (Ser) or Threonine (Thr) side chains. The N-glycans of higher organisms all contain a common pentasaccharide core structure (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ), which is also called trimannosyl chitobiose core [11]; in contrast, multiple O-glycan core structures exist, and there is considerable structural diversity in this glycan class ; in contrast, multiple O-glycan core structures exist, and there is considerable structural diversity in this glycan class [12]..\\nIn eukaryotes, the glycoprotein and N-linked glycans are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, involving enzymes that first accomplish synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor [13]. The process begins with the step-wise addition of monosaccharide residues by oligotransferases, leading to a 14-oligosaccharide core on the lipid carrier dolicholpyrophosphate (Dol-P). Once the seven-sugar precursor (Man 5 GlcNAc 2 -PP-dolichol) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, the whole complex is flipped across the membrane layer into the ER lumen, where four more mannose residues and three glucose residues are added. In a co-translational process, the assembled glycan is transferred to Asn residues on the nascent protein, within Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons via the action of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Figure .

Figure 2 depicts the whole process  depicts the whole process [14]. High-mannose N-glycans contain only mannose attached to the chitobiose core. During passage through the ER and Golgi, the mannoses on antennae are removed and other types of residues are added, thus reaching the complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are incompletely processed and retain at least one antenna containing mannose residues . High-mannose N-glycans contain only mannose attached to the chitobiose core. During passage through the ER and Golgi, the mannoses on antennae are removed and other types of residues are added, thus reaching the complex N-glycans.

N-Glycans play important roles in the quality control (QC) of glycoprotein folding in the ER lumen .

Glycoproteins will not pass ER quality control if they fail to reach the correct conformation . Glycoproteins will not pass ER quality control if they fail to reach the correct conformation [18]..\\nBy comparison, O-glycans have neither consensus sequence nor a consistent core structure; they are extremely diverse [19]. The process is typically initiated by adding a single Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue via glycosyltransferase . The process is typically initiated by adding a single Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue via glycosyltransferase [20]. Mammals have eight common O-glycan core structures .

O-Glycosylation also has significant effects on the solubility, conformation, stability and hydrophilicity of proteins [21]..\\nThe study of glycans, termed glycomics, is applied to biology and chemistry that focuses on the structure and function of carbohydrates, and on glycoform distributions at the cellular, tissue, organ and organism levels. A glycomics approach may combine three main aspects: the structural characterization of glycans, detailed understanding of glycan-protein interactions, and the study of in vitro and in vivo systems for the determination of function of specific glycans. This review focuses on the structural identification of glycans and determination of glycoform patterns, and summarizes recent techniques in mass spectrometric glycomics. Despite the important functions of oligosaccharides in biological systems, structural determination of these molecules is an analytical challenge compared to other biomolecules. Unlike linear peptides or nucleic acids, a very limited number of monosaccharides can form many stereoisomeric structures of carbohydrates. For structural elucidation, not only the monosaccharides (and their stereochemistry) need be identified, but also how they link together to form the polymers needs to be determined, which may include their sequence and branching pattern. Glycoform patterns and their changes may be measured at the semiquantitative or quantitative level; usually the values are expressed as relative rather than absolute changes. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the important tools for the structural characterization of carbohydrates, as it offers high sensitivity and addresses the most frequent biological problems. With the help of chromatographic separation, derivatization and mass spectral fragmentation, oligosaccharide structures can be elucidated.\\n\\nThe general approach for analyzing carbohydrates involves, first, the release of the glycan moiety from the glycoprotein. Two general methods are available for releasing carbohydrates: enzymatic methods and chemical methods. Enzymatic methods offer the advantage of preserving the information of the glycoprotein. The glycoprotein will not be degraded so that remains available for analysis. Specific enzymes are used to release Nlinked glycans from glycoproteins. Two types of enzymes are available, endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases; the former releases all or most of the glycan whereas the latter removes only a very specific portion of the non-reducing end of the glycan. Common endoglycosidases are the PNGase family which are amidases that release most N-glycans, e.g., PNGase F cleaves the bond between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagines residues of glycoproteins, releasing the carbohydrate and preserving the intact glycosylamine at the reducing end [22,23], although the amino group is quickly hydrolyzed and replaced by an hydroxyl group. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) cleaves between the GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose core for high mannose and hybrid glycans , although the amino group is quickly hydrolyzed and replaced by an hydroxyl group. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) cleaves between the GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose core for high mannose and hybrid glycans [24]. Exoglycosidases cleave one monosaccharide unit at a time from the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate chain and are frequently employed stepwise in conjunction with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) profiling of glycoforms, to facilitate assignment of the terminal monosaccharides and linkages . Exoglycosidases cleave one monosaccharide unit at a time from the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate chain and are frequently employed stepwise in conjunction with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) profiling of glycoforms, to facilitate assignment of the terminal monosaccharides and linkages [37]. Therefore, many features in the structure of the carbohydrate sample might be deduced from the enzymatic reaction(s). However, not all features of the sequences and linkages can be defined solely by using this approach. Hence, linkage analysis experiments that employ Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) are still necessary and are regularly employed for rigorous structure analysis..

However, not all features of the sequences and linkages can be defined solely by using this approach. Hence, linkage analysis experiments that employ Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) are still necessary and are regularly employed for rigorous structure analysis.\\nChemical release, which includes alkaline elimination and hydrazinolysis [25][26][27], preserves the carbohydrate moiety but degrades the glycoprotein. It is frequently used to release Olinked glycans from glycoproteins, since there is a dearth of glycosidases for release of Olinked glycans., preserves the carbohydrate moiety but degrades the glycoprotein. It is frequently used to release Olinked glycans from glycoproteins, since there is a dearth of glycosidases for release of Olinked glycans.\\nIn order to retain the information about site occupancy, N-linked glycan release may be carried out in the presence of 18 O-water, or an enzyme such as PNGase F1-F3 or endo H, that leave the first GlcNAc attached to the protein, may be employed. The determination of glycoform distributions at specific positions on the protein(s) requires that the sample be subjected to proteolysis and analyzed at the glycopeptide level, usually with on-or off-line chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry, or that the glycans be characterized after release from isolated glycopeptides.\\n\\nReleased sugars contain a single reactive carbonyl group at the reducing end that can be derivatized separately from the other hydroxyl groups. This property has been used to improve ionization, to add a stable isotope tag or to attach a chromophore for detection by High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) [28,29]. Reductive amination works for N-linked glycans released enzymatically from proteins and for any glycan that contains a reducing end. It is not applicable to O-glycans released under reductive conditions, while the aldehyde group is reduced to an alditol, but this group may also be derivatized efficiently or labelled with stable isotopes for structural or quantitative studies..

It is not applicable to O-glycans released under reductive conditions, while the aldehyde group is reduced to an alditol, but this group may also be derivatized efficiently or labelled with stable isotopes for structural or quantitative studies.\\nPermethylation is another important derivatization tool for investigation of glycan structures [30,31]. Carbohydrates are not ionized as efficiently as compounds such as proteins that can be protonated on many basic sites, neither do they appear to be transferred to the vapor phase as efficiently. Permethylation decreases the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the sample volatility and thus the intensity of the ion signals .

Furthermore, it can eliminate the negative charge associated with acidic residues, and thus stabilize acidic residues in the positive mode; this feature is especially important for the analysis of sialylated glycans in which the carboxyl group is located on the same carbon as the glycosidic linkage . Furthermore, it can eliminate the negative charge associated with acidic residues, and thus stabilize acidic residues in the positive mode; this feature is especially important for the analysis of sialylated glycans in which the carboxyl group is located on the same carbon as the glycosidic linkage [35]. The reaction pathways for reductive amination and permethylation are shown in Figure . The reaction pathways for reductive amination and permethylation are shown in Figure 3, also with several commonly used reagents for reductive amination , also with several commonly used reagents for reductive amination [36,37]..\\n\\nAfter release of the carbohydrates, the next stage is separation of the carbohydrates. This is not always necessary but it offers the advantage of reducing sample complexity, especially when dealing with biological samples. In most cases, the large variety of isomeric or closely related structures of carbohydrate moiety requires high performance separation techniques prior to mass spectrometry.\\nBoth native glycans and permethylated glycans can be separated by HPLC with a C 18 column. As noted above, reductive amination adds chromophores to native glycans, allowing the detection by Ultraviolet (UV) when using offline HPLC. Normal phase LC provides such regular separation of glycans (usually analyzed as derivatives with a chromophore at the reducing end) that the retention index scale is quite linear and can be used as a basis for assignments [38]. The combination of HPLC and MS (online HPLC) provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of native glycans, dramatically decreasing the effort and time requirements . The combination of HPLC and MS (online HPLC) provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of native glycans, dramatically decreasing the effort and time requirements [38]. Both offline and online liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) approaches are used for glycan or glycoconjugate profiling. Glycans/ glycoconjugates with low abundance, including N-linked glycans, O-linked glycans, glycopeptides and glycolipids, can be detected by LC/MS and this allows the analysis of complex mixtures .

When permethylation is applied to increase the hydrophobicity, glycans can be separated by reversed phase LC . When permethylation is applied to increase the hydrophobicity, glycans can be separated by reversed phase LC [42]..\\nPorous graphitized carbon chromatography (PGC) uses a solid phase that is composed of large macromolecules that are made up primarily of carbon atoms. There are two main mechanisms which may contribute to retention: hydrophobic interactions and electronic forces [43]. PGC shows an extraordinary isomeric selectivity to separate glycan isomers . PGC shows an extraordinary isomeric selectivity to separate glycan isomers [44,45]. It can also be used for desalting of glycans prior to mass spectrometry.. It can also be used for desalting of glycans prior to mass spectrometry.\\nHydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is a type of partition chromatography in which the retention mechanism is due the variations in the size and polarity of glycans. It is an effective tool for online LC/MS to analyze derivatized and reducing glycans [46] and peptides/glycopeptides  and peptides/glycopeptides [47]. However, it cannot separate isomers.. However, it cannot separate isomers.\\nIon mobility -mass spectrometry is an emerging method to distinguish isomers of glycans. IM-MS separates and identifies ionized molecules in the gas phase based on their mobility in the presence of a carrier buffer gas. In IMS-MS, a weak uniform electric field is applied across a drift tube to pull ions through the buffer gas. Compact isomers with higher mobility exit the drift tube earlier than those with lower mobility [48]. Recently, advances in the development of traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) have significantly increased sensitivity and speed .

Isomers of Man 7 GlcNAc 2 can be separated by the technique. IM-MS reduces the carbohydrate complexity in a given mass window. Use of tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with IM-MS can obtain much \"clearer\" fragmentation ions based on separated precursor ions compared to those previously detected in the mixture caused by overlap between isotopic distributions of their precursors .

Use of tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with IM-MS can obtain much \"clearer\" fragmentation ions based on separated precursor ions compared to those previously detected in the mixture caused by overlap between isotopic distributions of their precursors [52,53]. This will simplify the level of glycoform de novo identifications by mass spectrometry and make results much more definitive. The development of this and other mobility-based approaches is an especially active area of current MS research and development..

The development of this and other mobility-based approaches is an especially active area of current MS research and development.\\n\\nMass spectrometry (MS), in its most simple definition, is the production and detection of ions separated according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The detection of such ions results in a mass spectrum which is a plot of the relative abundance of the ions as a function of their m/z ratio. At present, the two most widely-used MS ionization techniques for the analysis of carbohydrates are Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) and Electrospray Ionization (ESI); in both free glycans are typically detected as metal (usually sodium) adducts in the positive ion mode, and as deprotonated or anion-adducted species in the negative-ion mode. Glycopeptides may be detected in their protonated or deprotonated forms. Both MALDI and ESI are soft ionization techniques; i.e., the ionization process imparts little excess energy and thus generates few or no fragments for glycans so that the intact molecular ions can be easily observed. Nevertheless, prompt loss of labile groups, especially sialic acid and fucose, may occur and the extent of its occurrence should be assessed, particularly in quantitative studies. Both MALDI-MS and ESI-MS can be applied to obtain an overall glycan profile. MALDI yields a series of singly charged molecular ions and the ionization efficiency for neutral carbohydrates is constant as the size of molecule increases, in contrast to that for ESI, where the ionization efficiency decreases with an increasing molecular weight [54]. Additionally, ESI usually generates multiply charged ions; although these complicate spectral analysis, especially when mixtures are introduced with on-or off-line separation, the instrument software can perform a deconvolution of the multiple charge states to produce a spectrum that shows a single molecular weight distribution. However, the signal is distributed over multiple charge states and this affects the ability to detect low-abundance species..

The Lipid A sample, extracted from the first batch cultivation of the bacterial cells, has three types monophosphorylated lipid molecules designated as M1, M2 and M3, respectively (see Figure 5a). Lipids M2 and M3 may result from fragmentation of the ion M1 or may represent variant products that arise from differences in the biosynthetic pathways.). Lipids M2 and M3 may result from fragmentation of the ion M1 or may represent variant products that arise from differences in the biosynthetic pathways.\\nAlthough MALDI-MS and ESI-MS spectra are highly suited to mass fingerprinting of glycan mixtures and is thus very valuable for initial stages of glycomic analysis, the lack of fragment ions can be a problem for detailed structural elucidation of glycans. This can be solved by making the molecular ions more energetic thereby inducing fragmentation, which is achieved by employing one or more well-controlled dissociation steps and tandem mass spectrometry.\\nTandem mass spectrometry (MS n ), including low-and high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) [56][57][58], infrared multiphoton dissociation , infrared multiphoton dissociation [59] and the newer electronbased dissociation methods  and the newer electronbased dissociation methods [60][61][62][63][64] has proven to be a powerful means for carbohydrate structural identification. Generally, glycans undergo two main types of cleavage upon CID: glycosidic cleavages resulting from the rupture between the two neighboring residues and cross-ring cleavages that involve the fragmentation of a sugar ring. The former provide information on composition and sequence, while the latter provide some details on the different linkage types. Internal fragments are generated upon the occurrence of two (or more) cleavages, either glycosidic or cross-ring, from more than one site in the molecule  has proven to be a powerful means for carbohydrate structural identification.

Many reports have shown that fragmentation of different metal-adducted oligosaccharides (Li + , Na + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , etc.) resulted in more cross-ring cleavages in low energy CID .

Permethlyation is used to stabilize the labile acidic groups which can be easily lost, particularly during MALDI ionization and in the analyzer under low or high energy CID . Permethlyation is used to stabilize the labile acidic groups which can be easily lost, particularly during MALDI ionization and in the analyzer under low or high energy CID [11,76]. Low energy CID generates mainly glycosidic cleavages. Fragments resulting from cross-ring cleavages, which can provide information needed for making detailed structural assignments, have quite low relative abundances or are absent. High energy CID can provide extensive informative fragments for analysis of oligosaccharides with smaller sizes . Low energy CID generates mainly glycosidic cleavages.

High energy dissociation in a sector mass spectrometer can produce many informative cleavages [65] but these instruments are now seldom available for glycan analysis. but these instruments are now seldom available for glycan analysis.\\nFor larger N-linked glycans with more complex structures, the most abundant cross-ring fragments detected with high-energy CID in a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer are often the 1,5 X n cleavages, but these are not unique enough to facilitate detailed structural assignments [78]. Negative ion CID is very useful for analysis of glycans with acidic monosaccharide residues. The Zaia group acquired a set of targeted negative CID spectra in automated mode on heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharides deriving from two different tissue sources.

Adamson et al. and Zhao et al. have investigated the application of electron capture dissociation (ECD) to both linear and branched oligosaccharides by utilizing FT-ICR mass spectrometers [63,64]. They showed that cross-ring cleavages were the dominant fragmentation pathway in ECD spectra. Whereas ECD is applied in the positive ion mode for characterization of neutral glycans, electron detachment dissociation (EDD) generates fragmentation in the negative mode for analysis of acidic glycans, and has been shown to be particularly useful for analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

Yu et al. investigated the application of electron energy-dependent electron activated dissociation (ExD) based on alkaline metal-adducted permethylated maltoheptaose in positive mode. Their data showed that such a glycan exhibits several fragmentation processes, including electron capture dissociation (ECD) (1.5eV), hot-ECD (9eV), and electronic excitation dissociation (EED) (14eV).

Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a fragmentation technique very similar to ECD, was introduced by Syka et al. for peptide/protein fragmentation [88]. ETD can be carried out in most mass spectrometers, including quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers, which are widely available. Recently, Han and Costello successfully applied ETD to investigations in a series of milk oligosaccharides and observed extensive cross-ring cleavages as well as other useful fragment ions; this feature of ETD greatly improves the capability of mass spectrometry to determine the linkage types and branching positions for glycans .

Over the past decade, the development of mass spectrometry has increased our knowledge and facilitated exploration of biological carbohydrates. Our understanding of the structures and diversity of glycans in biological samples has increased dramatically due, in large part, to the dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and variety of mass spectrometry approaches.

      "      \"Reason\": \"The extreme environment near Chernobyl has likely led to the evolution of microorganisms with unique capabilities. Enterobacter ludwigii Ez-185-17's EPS properties provide a dual function: allowing the bacteria to survive in harsh conditions and offering a mechanism to capture and immobilize heavy metals, thus reducing their bioavailability and toxicity.

The cervical canal is lined with mucus-producing glands that secrete thick mucus which acts as a physical barrier to pathogens and sperm during most of the menstrual cycle. During ovulation, the consistency of the mucus changes, becoming thinner and more alkaline, facilitating sperm entry into the uterine cavity for potential fertilization. Additionally, the cervix has a robust immune surveillance system that recognizes and responds to potential pathogens, providing an immunological barrier.

      "      \"Answer\": \"Plants convert glucose into polysaccharides through enzymatic processes. During photosynthesis, glucose is initially produced in the form of a simple sugar. This glucose can then follow different metabolic pathways to form cellulose or starch. Cellulose synthesis involves the polymerization of glucose molecules through β-1,4-glycosidic linkages to form long linear chains, which aggregate to form the structural component of the plant cell wall. In contrast, starch is produced through the formation of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds and sometimes α-1,6-glycosidic bonds, leading to a branched structure stored in plastids like chloroplasts and amyloplasts.\"\n",

The presence of terminal galactose on 75-85% of IgG molecules suggests enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), while the low incidence of sialylation may indicate limited anti-inflammatory properties compared to more sialylated glycoproteins. These glycosylation patterns can affect the efficacy and specificity of bovine-derived IgGs in therapeutic contexts, such as passive immunotherapy or antibody-based treatments, by mediating their interaction with immune cells and receptors.\"\n",
