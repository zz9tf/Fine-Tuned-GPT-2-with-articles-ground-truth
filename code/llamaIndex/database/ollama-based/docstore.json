Thus, mitochondrial\ncomplex inhibitors are often used for the development of experimental PD. In this study, we used\nrotenone to create in vitro cell models of PD, then used these models to investigate the effects of\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF), a monosaccharide with protective effects against a range of cytotoxic\nsubstances. Subsequently, we investigated the possible mechanisms of these protective effects in PC12\ncells. The protection of 1,5-AF against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity was con\ufb01rmed by increased cell\nviability and longer dendritic lengths in PC12 and primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, in rotenone-\ntreated PC12 cells, 1,5-AF upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1\n(PGC-1\u03b1) expression and enhanced its deacetylation, while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase\n(AMPK) phosphorylation. 1,5-AF treatment also increased mitochondrial activity in these cells.\nMoreover, PGC-1 \u03b1silencing inhibited the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF\nin PC12 cells. Therefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1through AMPK activation, thus leading to\nmitochondrial biogenic and cytoprotective effects. Together, our results suggest that 1,5-AF has\ntherapeutic potential for development as a treatment for PD.\nKeywords: 1,5-AF; 1,5-AG; metformin; Parkinson\u2019s disease; parkinsonism; AMPK; PGC-1 \u03b1; mito-\nchondria; mitochondrial biogenesis; rotenone\n1. Introduction\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases,\nespecially among older individuals. Because the aged population is gradually increas-\ning worldwide, treatments that inhibit the progression of this disease are increasingly\nimportant [ 1,2]. The causes and pathomechanisms of PD remain largely unknown; how-\never, it has been postulated that intrinsic or extrinsic neurotoxic metabolites or substances\nparticipate in its pathogenesis [ 3]. PD is strongly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in\nInt. J. Mol.

mechanisms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Thus, mitochondrial\ncomplex inhibitors are often used for the development of experimental PD. In this study, we used\nrotenone to create in vitro cell models of PD, then used these models to investigate the effects of\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF), a monosaccharide with protective effects against a range of cytotoxic\nsubstances. Subsequently, we investigated the possible mechanisms of these protective effects in PC12\ncells. The protection of 1,5-AF against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity was con\ufb01rmed by increased cell\nviability and longer dendritic lengths in PC12 and primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, in rotenone-\ntreated PC12 cells, 1,5-AF upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1\n(PGC-1\u03b1) expression and enhanced its deacetylation, while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase\n(AMPK) phosphorylation. 1,5-AF treatment also increased mitochondrial activity in these cells.\nMoreover, PGC-1 \u03b1silencing inhibited the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF\nin PC12 cells. Therefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1through AMPK activation, thus leading to\nmitochondrial biogenic and cytoprotective effects. Together, our results suggest that 1,5-AF has\ntherapeutic potential for development as a treatment for PD.\nKeywords: 1,5-AF; 1,5-AG; metformin; Parkinson\u2019s disease; parkinsonism; AMPK; PGC-1 \u03b1; mito-\nchondria; mitochondrial biogenesis; rotenone\n1.

Question: What is the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and its potential relationship with Parkinson's disease?\nAnswer: PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator that binds to and co-activates transcription factors, leading to mitochondrial biogenesis. The expression of PGC-1\u03b1-regulated genes is decreased in many Parkinson's disease patients, while increased PGC-1\u03b1expression protects against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. It is expected that models induced by neurotoxins, such as rotenone, will provide clues to the relationship between PD and mitochondrial biogenesis.\nReason: The role of PGC-1\u03b1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and its potential relationship with Parkinson's disease is a specific topic that is not widely covered in general knowledge sources. The information provided in the context offers unique insights into the molecular mechanisms behind this relationship and highlights the importance of further research in this area.\n2. Question: How does 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) activate AMPK and what are its potential cytoprotective effects?\nAnswer: Although the exact mechanism is not specified in the context, it has been reported that metformin, which currently is the most popular antidiabetic medicine, also activates AMPK, leading to mitochondrial biogenic activity via PGC-1\u03b1. 1,5-AF has previously shown cytoprotective effects against a range of proinflammatory and cytotoxic substances, including lipopolysaccharides, and it is expected that these effects are related to its activation of AMPK and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis.\nReason: The relationship between 1,5-AF, AMPK activation, and its potential cytoprotective effects is a unique aspect of the context that is not widely covered in general knowledge sources. The information provided offers a potential mechanism for the observed cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF, which could have implications for future therapeutic interventions.\n3. Question: How does rotenone induce cell models of Parkinson's disease and what are its potential applications in research?\nAnswer: Rotenone is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.

Because 50% of PC12 cells survived at a rotenone\nconcentration of 1 \u00b5M, PC12 cells were stimulated with rotenone at 1 \u00b5M for 24 h.

MitoTracker was used for\nmitochondrial staining. The import of MitoTracker into mitochondria depends on many\nfactors, e.g., mitochondrial mass, number of mitochondria per cell, and mitochondrial\nmembrane potential. 1,5-AF signi\ufb01cantly increased intracellular MitoTracker intensity\n(p< 0.01; Figure 7a,b). In addition, under rotenone stimulation, MitoTracker intensity\ndemonstrated a relative increase after 1,5-AF administration (Supplementary Figure S3);\nhowever, this change was unable to be evaluated absolutely because rotenone may de-\ncrease MitoTracker intensity by decreasing the membrane potential. Furthermore, 1,5-AF\nsigni\ufb01cantly increased intracellular ATP levels under conditions of rotenone exposure\n(p< 0.05; Figure 7c).

In contrast, in the control group, 1,5-AF signi\ufb01cantly in-\ncreased MitoTracker intensity per cell ( p< 0.05; Figure 8c,d). Even with rotenone treatment,\nthe 1,5-AF-induced increase in MitoTracker intensity was canceled in PC12 cells transfected\nwith PP ARGC1A siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4).

Discussion\nThe monosaccharide 1,5-AF that was used in the present study is constantly pro-\nduced from starch in very tiny amounts in the liver through the action of \u03b1-1,4-glucan\nlyase [ 15\u201317,19].This 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG, which can be used as a urinary\nmarker of renal function because 1,5-AG is reabsorbed from glucose transporter type 4\n(GLUT-4) [ 24]. However, the physiological functions of 1,5-AF and 1,5-AG remain un-\nknown. We therefore investigated the physiological functions of 1-5-AF. We have previously\nsucceeded in producing 1,5-AF in vitro from sweet potatoes [ 24]. In the present study, we\ndemonstrated that this 1,5-AF had cytoprotective effects that were exerted by protecting\nmitochondria from the mitochondrial toxin rotenone, which causes parkinsonism. Based\non these data, we propose that 1,5-AF may have therapeutic potential for the treatment\nof PD.\nIn the current study, the addition of increasing amounts of 1,5-AF prevented rotenone-\ninduced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in the PC12 cell line and primary neuronal\ncells. The cytoprotective activity of 1,5-AF against rotenone was also con\ufb01rmed by cellular\nimaging using calcein AM staining and through assessments of dendritic length in cultured\nprimary neuronal cells. There are two possible interpretations regarding these dendritic\nchanges. The \ufb01rst possibility is that the promotion of mitochondrial function enhances\nthat dendrite formation. This possibility is supported by our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF increased\nthe length of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive spines in neurons without\nrotenone treatment. Similarly, Li et al. reported [ 25] that mitochondrial activation increases\ndendritic spine length. The second possibility is that 1,5-AF inhibits rotenone-induced\ncell death. Dendritic spines are known to change morphologically early in the process of\nneuronal death, which is known as dendritic beading [ 26,27]. This has been observed as\na neuronal disorder in PD, and it has been reported that dendrites become shorter in the\nstriatum of PD patients [ 28,29]. Furthermore, one sign of dendritic beading is shortened\ndendritic length. Thus, our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF treatment reversed the rotenone-induced\ndendritic shortening suggests that 1,5-AF has cytoprotective effects.\nFurthermore, metformin is known to have mitochondrial protective activity [ 20]. In\nparticular, metformin reportedly activates AMPK, which in turn activates mitochondrial\nbiogenesis via PGC-1 \u03b1. AMPK is a major activator of various molecules and is believed\nto be activated by phosphorylation [ 23]. Activated AMPK then activates PGC-1 \u03b1via the\nactivation of SIRT1 [ 30,31]. PGC-1\u03b1is activated by deacetylation [ 31,32], and activated PGC-\n1\u03b1causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 33]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is the process by which\ncells increase the mass and copy number of individual mitochondria, thereby increasing\nATP production. Metformin is known to activate AMPK in hepatocytes and muscle\ncells [ 34]. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, metformin activates AMPK, increases\nexpression of PGC-1 \u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 22]. Furthermore, metformin\nincreases phosphorylated AMPK, increases expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) and\nPGC-1\u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells [ 23].\nIn the present study, treatment with metformin also led to increased dendritic length\ncompared with rotenone-treated cells. However, the 1,5-AF metabolite 1,5-AG did not have\nthis effect. Thus, although 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG in the kidney, the present\nstudy results suggest that this reduction does not occur rapidly in neuronal cell culture.\nIn addition, a relatively high concentration of metformin had protective effects against\nrotenone-induced mitochondrial toxicity in PC12 cells in the present study. In contrast, a\nrelatively low concentration of 1,5-AF had similar protective effects. These \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat, compared with metformin, 1,5-AF may have greater therapeutic potential against\nPD. However, to our knowledge, there have been relatively few investigations regarding\nthe metabolism and synthesis of 1,5-AF in the human body. In humans, potential clinical\napplications require in vivo analyses of 1,4-glucan lyase overexpression and the potential\ninhibition of 1,5-AF metabolism in the kidney.\nIn the current study, we also con\ufb01rmed that 1,5-AF upregulated PGC-1 \u03b1expression\nand enhanced its deacetylation, despite the presence of rotenone.

The second possibility is that 1,5-AF inhibits rotenone-induced\ncell death. Dendritic spines are known to change morphologically early in the process of\nneuronal death, which is known as dendritic beading [ 26,27]. This has been observed as\na neuronal disorder in PD, and it has been reported that dendrites become shorter in the\nstriatum of PD patients [ 28,29]. Furthermore, one sign of dendritic beading is shortened\ndendritic length. Thus, our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF treatment reversed the rotenone-induced\ndendritic shortening suggests that 1,5-AF has cytoprotective effects.\nFurthermore, metformin is known to have mitochondrial protective activity [ 20]. In\nparticular, metformin reportedly activates AMPK, which in turn activates mitochondrial\nbiogenesis via PGC-1 \u03b1. AMPK is a major activator of various molecules and is believed\nto be activated by phosphorylation [ 23]. Activated AMPK then activates PGC-1 \u03b1via the\nactivation of SIRT1 [ 30,31]. PGC-1\u03b1is activated by deacetylation [ 31,32], and activated PGC-\n1\u03b1causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 33]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is the process by which\ncells increase the mass and copy number of individual mitochondria, thereby increasing\nATP production. Metformin is known to activate AMPK in hepatocytes and muscle\ncells [ 34]. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, metformin activates AMPK, increases\nexpression of PGC-1 \u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 22].

J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9941 10 of 16\ndownregulated the expression of PGC-1 \u03b1, this effect was attenuated by co-treatment with\n1,5-AF. Moreover, 1,5-AF treatment led to increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1in vitro while\ninducing PGC-1 \u03b1expression. 1,5-AF treatment also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation;\ntherefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1in an AMPK-dependent manner leading to mi-\ntochondrial biogenic activity and cytoprotection. While these effects may be present in\nthe absence of rotenone, they appear essential for protecting against rotenone-induced\ncytotoxicity. Additionally, 1,5-AF without rotenone treatment increased dendritic length\nand mitochondrial biogenesis, but it did not signi\ufb01cantly increase PGC-1 \u03b1protein levels.\nThis may be related to the considerable variability in observed PGC-1 \u03b1levels; nonetheless,\nthese levels tended to increase without rotenone treatment.\nThe cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF were inhibited when PGC-1 \u03b1was silenced by\nPP ARGC1A siRNA transfection. In addition, although 1,5-AF treatment led to increased\nMitoTracker intensity and activity of mitochondria, these effects were also inhibited when\nPGC-1\u03b1was silenced. Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that PGC-1 \u03b1is essential for both\nthe cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment. While we\ncannot rule out the possibility that 1,5-AF is involved in other unidenti\ufb01ed pathways, the\n\ufb01ndings in PP ARGC1A siRNA experiments suggest that the primary pathway is as follows:\n1,5-AF activates AMPK leading to PGC-1 \u03b1activation, which contributes to mitochondrial\nprotection and proliferation. As mentioned above, these effects may be present in the\nabsence of rotenone; they also appear to be essential for protection against rotenone-\ninduced cytotoxicity. Future studies (based on our preliminary in vitro \ufb01ndings) should\nconsider directly targeting PGC-1 \u03b1levels and investigate the potential therapeutic effects\nof this protein in an in vivo model.\nThis study had some limitations. First, we could not con\ufb01rm the in vitro effects in vivo\nbecause of regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan. To test the\neffects of 1,5-AF in vivo , we are currently developing a PD animal model using alternative\nmethods. These methods include a Drosophila model, in which rotenone treatment can\ninduce mitochondrial defects and dopaminergic neuronal loss [ 35]. Second, in the current\nstudy, rotenone and 1,5-AF were generally administered simultaneously. In PD in humans,\nhowever, cell loss begins long before therapeutics can be administered. Thus, future studies\nshould explore the effects of 1,5-AF at a range of time points after rotenone exposure. Our\npreliminary analysis suggested a potential cytoprotective effect in PC12 cells exposed to\nrotenone for 1 h, followed by exposure to 1,5-AF in rotenone-free media for 24 h ( p< 0.05,\ncompared with rotenone alone; Supplementary Figure S5). These effects imply the potential\nfor development and eventual application in the treatment of patients with current PD;\nto our knowledge, there is no oral medication that can fully reverse the effects of PD in\nclinical practice. Third, we could not test the effects of 1,5-AG and metformin in all of\nthe presented experimental conditions. Concerning 1,5-AG, we were limited by \ufb01nancial\nconstraints. At the same time, the effects of metformin in this study depended on the use\nof a high drug dose, which affected other experimental reagents and made measurements\nchallenging. We suspect that these changes in experimental reagents may have been related\nto cellular acidosis, based on the side effect of lactic acidosis observed during the clinical\napplication of metformin [ 36,37]. Notably, we excluded metformin from experiments\nother than those shown in Figures 4\u20136because those \ufb01ndings strongly implied that the\neffects of 1,5-AF were similar to those of metformin; this is consistent with a published\napproach [ 22]. In future studies, we will explore the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AG in a\nmore extensive range of experiments. Fourth, some assessments of cytoprotective effects\n(i.e., results in Figure 4) were performed using pooled data; the resulting variability among\nconditions may have in\ufb02uenced the strength of statistical comparisons. Fifth, mitochondrial\nmembrane potential may be reduced upon rotenone administration; thus, the intracellular\nmitochondrial mass estimated by the MitoTracker assay may be lower under conditions of\nrotenone administration [ 38]. In future analyses of 1,5-AF, the mitochondrial mass should\nbe investigated by using \ufb02uorescent probes such as nonyl acridine orange, for which\nmitochondrial uptake is unaffected by membrane potential [ 39].", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4715, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5753f39-8470-479d-b32b-e581d225eff6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5753f39-8470-479d-b32b-e581d225eff6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers": "1. <1, 2>\nQuestion: How does 1,5-AF activate PGC-1 \u03b1?\nAnswer: 1,5-AF treatment led to increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1 in vitro while inducing PGC-1 \u03b1 expression, suggesting that it may activate PGC-1 \u03b1 in an AMPK-dependent manner leading to mitochondrial biogenic activity and cytoprotection.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the specific mechanism of how 1,5-AF activates PGC-1 \u03b1, which is a key player in the cytoprotective effects of this compound.

The cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF were inhibited when PGC-1 \u03b1 was silenced by siRNA transfection, and these effects were also inhibited when PGC-1\u03b1 was silenced.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the specific role of PGC-1 \u03b1 in the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41f2ee16-74fa-4879-a4ae-18f9ec12a4cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "eadbd87e390f6149087d913e007450f2485a23c4e9151fa93b64d92177a30ce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "163577a2-6baa-4ccf-8dff-508fdd2af1d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "407345a7422fe54d30251e7f6a702b196328877f62463136074f0990df8576eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "41f2ee16-74fa-4879-a4ae-18f9ec12a4cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "eadbd87e390f6149087d913e007450f2485a23c4e9151fa93b64d92177a30ce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "b99f59b9-4e19-491a-a099-695d6e702de7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "14972248374e5af5d5da804779407e6ffd5b3b7304e45131c120ed0e7aeacd0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fe8c2c47-4fc5-4f04-bded-c0bb3c66ae44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "c6882d4970e4e868b0fd3ee4b693aafdba33b84571cad73e75410a892a9aa255", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "187f1a13-4b06-4ac4-8219-7bcafd677116", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "3cd1faf85e9cc0c070af690d83ac762cad65731f686ab3559cbcc8ae8fc25f07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "4beb0064-2587-4185-8d79-4dee92faa5a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "0a2b22bb174fde35e0b9887519587a261091577c55e9f96b5db4f897b2e03a41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "494072e9-ed15-477c-931f-b854879942b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "9111dcdd94bae6a57079377228ec3ab69fd7cc155041e51f311ccca71b162768", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "cbde2e99-5210-40db-8f78-4ee06756c941", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "4db1618250e0576408459b3312dd2e5ad746d2d1dc2f61495884b08510bf66fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "c4a4d2c5-1e3d-4df6-9e29-0d3528cce199", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "e98bdd2c412188be3270cc9c1cc1e6f7fa8335a83c00196291c8dc0c28d756b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Int.

What is the main finding of the study and how does it relate to the protection against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity?\nAnswer: The main finding of the study is that 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) protects against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. This protection appears to be essential and may be present even in the absence of rotenone.\nReason: This question directly asks about the main finding of the study and its relevance to the protection against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity, which is a central theme of the given context.\n2. What are some limitations of the current study and how might they impact future research?\nAnswer: The limitations of the current study include the inability to confirm the in vitro effects in vivo due to regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan, and the fact that rotenone and 1,5-AF were generally administered simultaneously. Future studies should explore the effects of 1,5-AF at a range of time points after rotenone exposure and investigate the potential therapeutic effects of this protein in an in vivo model.\nReason: This question highlights the limitations of the current study and suggests possible directions for future research that could address these limitations.\n3. What are some potential applications of 1,5-AF in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD)?\nAnswer: Based on the preliminary analysis presented in the context, 1,5-AF appears to have potential cytoprotective effects against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells.

To investigate the\ntoxicity of rotenone to PC12 cells, we dissolved rotenone in DMSO at \ufb01nal concentrations\nranging from 0 to 100 \u00b5M, then exposed the cells to this dissolved rotenone for 24 h, based\non previous reports [ 45,46]. The concentration of rotenone at which 50% of PC12 cells\nsurvived was 1 \u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S1). In experiments with primary mouse\nneuronal cells, rotenone was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 50 nM, based on\nprevious reports [ 45,46]. Monolayer cells were then treated with or without rotenone\nand with or without either 1,5-AF (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), 1,5-AG (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), or metformin\n(1.25 mM) for 24 h.\n4.3.

Anti-MAP2 Immuno\ufb02uorescence Staining\nThe protective activity of 1,5-AF against the cytotoxic effects of rotenone was evaluated\non the basis of dendritic morphology and length. Dendrites were visualized by staining\nthe cells with an anti-MAP2 antibody. Brie\ufb02y, primary neuronal cells were plated in poly-L-\nlysine-coated 48-well dishes. Cells were \ufb01xed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,\nwashed with PBS, and incubated in blocking solution for 20 min. Cells were then incubated\nwith antibodies speci\ufb01c for MAP2, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies\ncoupled to CF488. Next, cells were washed with PBS, then stained with 0.25\u00b5g/mL\nHoechst 33342 in PBS. Finally, the cells were analyzed using ImageJ.\n4.5. Immunoblotting\nCell monolayers were stimulated by 1 \u00b5M rotenone for 24 h with or without 1,5-\nAF (50\u00b5g/mL) or metformin (1.25 mM). The medium was then washed out, and the\nmonolayers were rinsed using saline. For the detection of PGC-1 \u03b1and other proteins,\nimmunoblotting was performed. Brie\ufb02y, cell lysates were diluted 1:1 in 2 \u00d7sample buffer\n(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol,\nand 0.01% bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Next, 5 \u00b5g of protein from each lysate\nwas separated on a polyacrylamide gel, blotted on a polyvinylidene \ufb02uoride membrane,\nand probed with antibodies against PGC-1 \u03b1and the other proteins.

What is the relationship between metformin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mechanism of action?\nQuestion: Can you explain the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the mechanism of action of metformin?\nAnswer: Metformin increases AMPK activity, which promotes glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. [34]\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the specific mechanism of action of metformin through the involvement of AMPK. The answer provides a direct relationship between metformin and AMPK, which may not be apparent from a general search for information about metformin's benefits.\n2. How does metformin-induced lactic acidosis impair cancer cell response to paclitaxel and doxorubicin?\nQuestion: What is the role of monocarboxylate transporter in metformin-induced lactic acidosis, and how does it affect cancer cells' response to paclitaxel and doxorubicin?\nAnswer: Metformin-induced lactic acidosis impairs cancer cell response to paclitaxel and doxorubicin by decreasing their uptake through monocarboxylate transporter. [36]\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the specific mechanism of how metformin-induced lactic acidosis affects cancer cells' response to two different drugs, paclitaxel and doxorubicin, through monocarboxylate transporter. The answer provides a clear explanation of this relationship, which may not be easily found in general searches for information about metformin's side effects or its impact on cancer cells.\n3. What is the role of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) in rotenone-induced apoptosis in liver cells?\nQuestion: How does the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) contribute to rotenone-induced apoptosis in liver cells, and what is its relationship with metformin-associated lactic acidosis?\nAnswer: The MPT plays a role in rotenone-induced apoptosis in liver cells by causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis may impair the response of cancer cells towards paclitaxel and doxorubicin through monocarboxylate transporter, which is involved in MPT. [36, 37]\nReason: This question is unique because it explores the relationship between two different topics - mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) and metformin-associated lactic acidosis - and how they may be connected through monocarboxylate transporter. The answer provides an interesting connection between these two concepts, which may not be easily found in general searches for information about MPT or metformin's side effects.\n4. Can the Drosophila melanogaster model organism be used to study Parkinson's disease?\nQuestion: What is the potential use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for studying Parkinson's disease, and what are some limitations or challenges in using this approach?\nAnswer: Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a model organism to study Parkinson's disease due to its genetic tractability, transgenic capabilities, and the presence of dopaminergic neurons. However, there are also limitations such as the lack of a complete nervous system and the differences in neuroanatomy and physiology between flies and humans. [35]\nReason: This question is unique because it explores the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for studying Parkinson's disease, which may not be commonly discussed in general

What are some neuroprotective effects of fructose against rotenone-induced oxidative stress?\nAnswer: The article suggests that fructose may have neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced oxidative stress, as it was able to reduce the level of ROS and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in mesencephalic neurons. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the specific mechanisms involved.\nReason: This question specifically addresses one of the main findings of the study and highlights the potential neuroprotective effects of fructose against rotenone-induced oxidative stress, which may not be readily apparent from reading the abstract alone.\n2. How does anhydro-D-fructose affect mitochondrial function in mesencephalic neurons?\nAnswer: The article suggests that anhydro-D-fructose may enhance mitochondrial function by increasing the activity of complex I and promoting the formation of supercomplex I+III. This, in turn, leads to increased ATP production and improved resistance against rotenone-induced oxidative stress.\nReason: This question specifically focuses on one of the key findings of the study and highlights the potential mechanisms by which anhydro-D-fructose may enhance mitochondrial function in mesencephalic neurons.\n3. What is the role of PACAP in neurite outgrowth, and how does it relate to the findings of this study?\nAnswer: PACAP (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide) has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth by activating mitochondrial function. The findings of this study suggest that anhydro-D-fructose may also enhance mitochondrial function, which could potentially lead to increased neurite outgrowth. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the specific mechanisms involved.\nReason: This question highlights the potential connection between PACAP-dependent neurite outgrowth and the findings of this study, as both involve the activation of mitochondrial function.\n4. What are some potential therapeutic implications of the findings in this study?\nAnswer: The findings in this study suggest that anhydro-D-fructose may have neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced oxidative stress and could potentially be used as a therapeutic agent to protect mesencephalic neurons. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the safety and efficacy of anhydro-D-fructose as a therapeutic agent.\nReason: This question highlights the potential clinical implications of the study's findings and emphasizes the need for further research to confirm the safety and efficacy of anhydro-D-fructose as a therapeutic agent.\n5. How do the findings in this study compare to previous studies on the neuroprotective effects of rotigotine?\nAnswer: The article suggests that rotigotine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced oxidative stress, but that anhydro-D-fructose may be a more effective agent due to its ability to enhance mitochondrial function by increasing the activity of complex I and promoting the formation of supercomplex I+III. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the specific mechanisms involved.\nReason: This question compares the neuroprotective effects of rotigotine with those of anhydro-D-fructose and highlights the potential advantages of anhydro-D-fructose in terms of enhancing mitochondrial function."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b20530ea-9ac7-420d-a270-444fc116b7d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "96871137d01c6b89482365c08db498019a84fc405715437129415fdbedcc5a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "b20530ea-9ac7-420d-a270-444fc116b7d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "96871137d01c6b89482365c08db498019a84fc405715437129415fdbedcc5a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "4b739c28-6daa-48ab-a1d6-3650c8e76b37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "fc9632e9cc1357eb3b17412f290e0ef281d2b2623be12afb51dd38a2cc4f8d4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "699d8dfb-b7d9-4ef0-8eec-3301f07a7966", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "e375e022dab50eca44bb1b9f99f0c9a8aa91c0f762a0bfe919d1ff9145a24fe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2128ccb1-6c6b-46d9-aad3-4e03d52aa453", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "728506e13c82d8e82663231b342cea8c1a1ff1c502785e3cef3238a784ca93f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "17479ac4-ecba-4131-be99-4d7764cf7332", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "f2839d45e6d17b6b378a5282aacc10266d667a85bcc314583da4fbc152466241", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "41051a52-0b0d-4f9c-98d2-ab26d8c290c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "60d3d629c586f954e8612de79ae71e0a08136eb9aaa692af2e293742b1b47bbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a7a29a59-ee64-4c5b-93ab-bd1a1efbab22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "e8a4464d351b3b16d6fe3e66b4009e30a6e1b0457a1c8449567ae89adb14b184", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "8e2557df-583c-4cbb-874b-7f2d2d61b1c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "b305d99f7cf8e3eb4e71a1d29907df3d4ca7c011e89b084e90cf4236355800aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ca1ab1c1-bb9a-40b6-b5da-5330cdccb2ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "2753802a41b95ac00135316f95dd4b56a76b02a7fc1f018f81a60f5877abbbf7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Int.
