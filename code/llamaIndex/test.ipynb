      "One Paragraph of [1. Abstract]: Parkinson's disease is a chronic illness classified within the category of neurodegenative diseases along with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia and others. It consists of progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its onset was correlated with aging, toxic events, and metabolic causes. There is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance in Parkinson's disease, although a genetic component was incriminated in a small percentage of cases. There is strong evidence that it may be caused largely by oxidative stress and metal toxicity; patients have low levels of natural antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and high leve ls of iron in the substantia nigra and other areas of their brain, leading to the hypothesis that iron and other transition metals help catalyze the free radical reactions that destroy the dopaminergic neurons, and that high levels of antioxidants (e.g., uric acid, flavonoids, ubiquinone) may help prevent or slow down the progress of Parkinson's disease. This review paper is dedicated to analyzing this hypothesis and also attempts to define possible future directions of investigation.\n",
      "[2. Introduction]\n",
      "One Paragraph of [2. Introduction]: Parkinson's disease is a chronic illness due to the progressive degeneration of those neurons that normally produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to a dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. It is characterized by the following symptoms: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement) or akinesia (absence or difficulty in initiating movement), shuffling gait, and stooped posture; depression or dementia may also be present at later stages.\n",
      "One Paragraph of [2. Introduction]: The most characteristic symptom, the accentuated tremor, led the British physician who first described this disease in 1817, James Parkinson, to name it \"shaking palsy\". Parkinson's disease is more common among men than among women and is four times more frequent in Caucasians than in darkly pigmented races. In the United States, PD affects about 1% of the population over age 60 [1]. Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed . Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed [1]. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect. Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are also used. Avaiable surgical techniques are either ablative (thalamotomy and pallidotomy), augmentative (high-frequency deep-brain stimulation) or restaurative (gene therapy and neurotransplantation). Additiona l adjunctive therapies include physical therapy and nutritional counseling. However, the treatment is not curative; it can only relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease .

      "One Paragraph of [2. Introduction]: The remainder of this review paper is devoted to a brief anatomical background and to the analysis of the current hypothesis of the international research community stating that free radical toxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "[3. Pathological anatomy]\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: The basal ganglia are a conglomeration of five distinguishable interconnected nuclei located at the base of the brain: the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum (consisting of caudate nucleus and putamen) and the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia became known as a component of the so-called extrapyramidal system, which is interconnected and cooperates with the pyramidal (corticospinal) system. The basal ganglia play an important role in voluntary movement and also have a role in cognitive function [2]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: The substantia nigra is a pigmented mass of neurons located in the midbrain (mesencephalon) between the cerebral peduncles and the tegmentum. It is composed of a dorsal pars compacta containing melanin pigment, a ventral pars reticulata containing iron compounds, and a pars lateralis. The dendrites of neurons in the pars compacta arborize in the pars reticulata. The neuronal population of the substantia nigra consists of pigmented and nonpigmented neurons. Pigmented neurons outnumber nonpigmented neurons two to one. The neurotransmitter in pigmented neurons is dopamine. Nonpigmented neurons are either cholinergic or GABAergic. There is a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in different disease states. Both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons are lost in patients with Huntington's chorea, another neurodegenerative disease of basal ganglia origin, which differs from PD in that it is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Only pigmented (dopaminergic) neurons are lost in PD. In idiopathic PD this loss occurs mostly in the center of the substantia nigra, while in the postencephalitic type of PD the pattern is uniform throughout the substantia nigra [2]. Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) . Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) [2]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: In postmortem studies it was discovered that the substantia nigra (meaning \"black substance\") had lost its pigment in PD patients. The pigment is called neuromelanin and was commented on as long ago as 1786 by Vicq d'Azyr. Apart from the substantia nigra, neuromelanin is also located in the locus coeruleus in the pons, where the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. It is certain, however, that neuromelanin is a recent phylogenetic development and it appears that the intensity of pigmentation is related to the degree of evolution of the brain.\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: Neuromelanin is present only in the brain of humans, primates and some carnivores, e.g. the dog and the cat; it does not appear to be present in the brain of common laboratory animals, such as the rat, the guinea pig, and the rabbit. Evidence suggests that neuromelanin is not synthesized by a tyrosine-tyrosinase system as in skin melanocytes, but by a different pathway involving oxidation of brain catecholamines, in particular dopamine. Moreover, there is a striking similarity between the distribution of neuromelanin and that of the brain catecholaminesnorepinephrine and dopamine [3]. These anatomical findings inevitably led to the conclusion that melanin in neurons is intimately related to the ability of these cells to synthesize dopamine or norepinephrine. Indeed, neuromelanin may be looked upon as an indication of catecholamine synthesis in neuronal systems containing dopamine or norepinephrine. The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species .

A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species [3]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: Neuromelanin has a strict anatomical localization and a late evolutionary appearance which suggest that it serves some positive function. Melanin deposition may provide a mechanism of inactivation of some metabolic product possibly of catecholamine origin which cannot be removed from neurons by other means. Alternatively, the chemical constituents of melanin, in particular the heavy metals it contains -zinc, copper, iron, manganese, titanium, cobalt, and nickel -may influence neuronal metabolism. A significant feature of neuromelanin is the presence of free semiquinone radicals, which might influence oxidation-reduction reactions [3]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [3. Pathological anatomy]: Parkinson's disease affects the cytoskeleton and damage occurs only in selectively vulnerable neurons. As a result of the cytoskeletal changes, the so-called Le wy bodies may appear; their major components are abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments, in other words altered \"building blocks\" of the cytoskeleton. The Lewy bodies are concentric hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions seen in pigmented nigral cells, but not in all cases of PD (e.g., not in those cases following encephalitis letargica) [3]..\n",
      "[4. Physiopathology]\n",
      "One Paragraph of [4. Physiopathology]: Parkinsonism may occur following carbon monoxide poisoning or cranial trauma ( e.g. dementia pugilistica, a condition seen in professional boxers such as Muhammad Ali).\n",
      "One Paragraph of [4. Physiopathology]: Parkinson's disease may also develop later in life, in connection with a neurotoxic event that occurred at an early age, e.g. encephalitis lethargica or a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic infection. Certain diuretics (e.g. reserpine), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (e.g. naproxen), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) and \"designer drugs\" (e.g. MPTP) have all been implicated in causing or exacerbating PD. Environmental and dietary factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, i.e. occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides, the high intake of animal fats, the high intake of sugars (mono-and disaccharides), the high aluminum content of drinking water, the mercury from dental amalgams, the presence of other metals, notably manganese, cadmium and copper, as well as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. multiple lacunar strokes) [4]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [4. Physiopathology]: A consensus is now emerging that major causes of neurodegenerative diseases in general, and PD in particular, are oxidative stress (i.e., an excess of free radicals) and metal toxicity [5]..\n",
      "One Paragraph of [4. Physiopathology]: The following section of this paper is devoted to the critical review of this hypothesis. In relation to this hypothesis, one of the above-mentioned causative factors, MPTP, is entitled to a special discussion. MPTP-induced parkinsonism is a model for PD in human and non-human primates and was discovered accidentally. In 1982, several heroin addicts in California and Maryland suddenly developed acute and permanent parkinsonism after injecting a synthetic opiate containing the impurity MPTP. The symptoms required constant levodopa treatment ever since. MPTP is converted by the neuronal enzyme MAO-B into its toxic metabolite MPP + which has structural similarities to dopamine and is taken up into the dopaminergic nerve terminal by the dopamine uptake system where it causes cell damage. Another drug, selegiline (or deprenyl), an almost forgotten substance that was invented by a Hungarian scientist and failed its purpose as an antidepressant, was found to have antagonist actions to MPTP since it is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, preventing dopamine depletion and PD symptoms [6]. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.\n",
      "[5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]\n",
      "One Paragraph of [5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]: One of the leading hypotheses nowadays is that oxidative stress by ROS damages essential components of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, including DNA, protein structures and the cell membrane, resulting in functional disruption and ultimate cell death. These free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism, but specific cellular detoxification systems normally minimize their damaging effects [7]. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:.

      "One Paragraph of [5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]: 1) increased membrane peroxidation in the SNc and widespread ROS-induced protein modification, with protein carbonyl levels elevated in all regions of the brain [7,8];;\n",
      "One Paragraph of [5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]: 2) elevated TBA-reactive substance levels (a measure of the secondary products of lipid peroxidation) accompanied by decreased PUFA levels (the peroxidation substrate) [8];;\n",
      "One Paragraph of [5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]: 3) increased 8-hydroxy-2′deoxyguanosine levels in the SNc and other brain regions, indicative of ROS-mediated DNA damage [7,9]. Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage .

      "One Paragraph of [5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]: There are several potential metabolic sources of increased oxidative stress in PD: dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free iron levels, accumulation of AGEs, reduced activity of free radical defense systems, and the deleterious role of glial cells. Several toxins may also be implicated in PD. A brief discussion is devoted to each of these hypotheses.\n",
      "[6. 1) Dopamine metabolism]\n",
      "One Paragraph of [6. 1) Dopamine metabolism]: Dopamine is oxidized in the brain via two pathways. a) Auto-oxidation of dopamine leads to the production of toxic semiquinone species (SQ • ), which via a metabolic cascade can be polymerized to neuromelanin. Little can be said with certainty about the effect of neuromelanin on neuronal function. It is generally regarded as a waste product of dopamine auto-oxidation and as a \"double-edged sword\" with respect to free radical reactions, in that it sequesters redox-active metal ions (such as iron), but may also promote ROS-generating processes and may also represent a depot for other cellular toxins, such as MPP + [11]. b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is: . b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion.

This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A .

      "One Paragraph of [7. 2) Mitochondrial dysfunction]: Evidence implying that mitochondria have a crucial role in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is accumulating rapidly. Both these conditions are distinctive forms of cell death, as defined morphologically; however, in neuronal populations and diseases such as PD they can either coexist or be sequential events. Fig. 1 (from  (from [12]) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. ) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death.

      "One Paragraph of [7. 2) Mitochondrial dysfunction]: The CNS has a particularly high energy requirement, thus making it very susceptible to  One of the known substrates of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD consists of abnormalities of the respiratory chain (schematically drawn in Fig. 2, from , from [13]). The respiratory chain consists of five complexes aligned along the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The functions of the respiratory chain are proton pumping, electron transport, conversion of atomic oxygen into water, and, most importantly, production of energy in the form of ATP. In total, the five enzyme complexes are formed by more than 80 subunits; 13 of these are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the others by nuclear DNA. In MPTP-induced parkinsonism, MPTP is metabolized to MPP + which is preferentially stored in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, where it inhibits complex I of the electron-transport chain, leading to reductions in ATP production and elevated ROS generation, which in turn result in oxidative damage to various cell structures ).

Complex II contains three Fe-S clusters, only one of which is tetranuclear (4Fe-4S) cluster.

In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN.

      "One Paragraph of [12. 7) The generation of free radicals by toxins in PD]: A scientist true to the classical conception of the anatomical school would indeed choose to pursue the hard facts: that only pigmented neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease, and will focus on neuromelanin as an indication of catecholamine synthesis or a side-product of dopamine auto-oxidation in neurons. The properties of neuromelanin will certainly have to be investigated in detail, since its chemical identity with oculocutaneous melanin has never been established. Valuable starting points are the facts that: 1) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is localized in neurons and not in melanocytes; 2) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is present (spared) in the genetic disease albinism -an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase; 3) the skin pigment seems to be a protective factor in some races against neurodegeneration, a cutaneous barrier that would bind toxins as neuromelanin binds MPP + ; 4) primary malignant mela nomas of the CNS are not recorded; 4) neuromelanin binds and accumulates heavy metals. Regarding the comparison with skin melanin, it is significant that pigmented cells called melanophores in heterothermic vertebrates (e.g. amphibians) possess dopamine receptors that mediate melanosome aggregation and melonosome dispersion, and also receptors for norepinephrine [33]. Thus the ligand-receptor type of interaction between dopamine and melanin could be further explored at epithelial and neural level; on the basis of dose-response curves, a characterization of these receptors could be attempted as a function of agonist affinity; the goal of such a research project would be the identification of several classes of receptors based on differences in their expression. The histochemical and spectroscopic properties of neuromelanin will have to be studied in detail, since the anatomical distribution, the biochemical pathways and the selective vulnerability to various diseases do not argue in favor of their chemical identity. A logical starting point would be the examination of the spatial structures of these biopolymers generally called melanins by Xray diffraction techniques in a synchrotron radiation facility, by following changes in diffraction data during polymerization or depolymerization of melanins. This may help understanding the structural changes at different levels of organization in melanins. Also, since neuromelanin contains small amounts of metals, the immediate chemical environment of the heavy atom in the melanin structure and the location of the binding sites may also be worth investigating, and the most appropriate technique would probably be EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure). The principle of EXAFS is that when X-rays traverse a sample under study, the transmitted beam suffers an attenuation which normally changes monotonically; if the sample contains a heavy atom, the attenuation increase steeply. Conventional techniques as Perls staining and transmission electron microscopy have failed to properly serve the purposes of identifying neuromelanin granules in brain slices, but a promising technique is LAMMA (laser microprobe mass analyzer), an advanced type of mass spectrophotometer; the recording of peaks corresponds to increased quantities of iron and aluminum that may exist in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it is important to note that neuromelanin is believed to coexist in granules with lipofuscin, and that the nature of their association is at present very poorly understood; a starting point for future directions of research would be the model system in which bleaching with hydrogen peroxide gradually converts the optical and histochemical properties of melanin to those of lipofuscin and the reverse, in which lipofuscin, experimentally melanized with catecholamines, acquires characteristic optical properties of neuromelanin .

      "One Paragraph of [2. 13 C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism]: Glucose is considered the physiologic energy substrate of the brain and is used by all brain cells, neurons and glial cells alike. Glucose consumption is tightly coupled to the need for energy (ATP), which in the brain largely reflects neuronal activity, or more specifically, depolarization of neuronal cell membranes. The membrane potential derives from the ionic gradients created by ion pumps that transport sodium and potassium against their concentration gradients across cell membranes, an activity that is fuelled by ATP (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001). Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. .

Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves many functions in the brain, it has been estimated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain glutamate serves a neurotransmitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006).

In fact, any 13 C-labeled substrate that gives rise to 13 C-labeled acetyl-CoA will label glutamate and glutamine in positions that reflect the entry of label into the TCA cycle and its subsequent turning in the cycle. This applies to 13 C-labeled lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate, glycerol, and others. However, substrates that give C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 39 rise to 13 C-labeled pyruvate in the brain (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glycerol) may enter the TCA cycle through two different enzymatic routes. The first, which gives rise to acetyl-CoA, is pyruvate dehydrogenase, which removes a carboxylic group from pyruvate in the form of CO 2 . The second route involves the addition of a carboxylic group (from CO 2 or HCO 3 -) to pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate or its immediate precursor malate (See upper part of Fig. 7); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme. These reactions are 'anaplerotic', meaning that they function to 'fill up' the TCA cycle with intermediates. They are thought to compensate for the loss of α-ketoglutarate inherent in export of glutamine from astrocytes and for the similar loss of α-ketoglutarate inherent in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission when (See below) astrocytes take up glutamate or GABA from the synaptic cleft.

This carbon position corresponds to the 2 nd carbon in glutamate and glutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2 nd than the 3 rd carbon in glutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes (Shank et al., 1993;Hassel et al., 1995a;Serres et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons.

However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure , uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively.

CONCLUSION]: In response to the FDA interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market, there is a need to develop tests for the identity of the heparin animal and tissue origin. The method developed here, is an alternative to that proposed by ANVISA, that is able not only to distinguish BMH from PMH, but also to confirm that the sample was not manufactured from other heparin sources such as bovine lung or ovine mucosa. The method, based on measurement of a proton NMR spectrum, is not much different from that present in both US and EU pharmacopeias for the identification of PMH heparin. A method utilizing the intensity ratios among selected signals was indeed already used in several pharmacopeia monographs to detect the presence of possible unknown contaminant (7).

      "One Paragraph of [10. CONCLUSION]: Nevertheless, overlapping signals on the proton NMR spectra prevent signals of minor structural signatures to be detected. For example, the presence of epoxidated or galacturonic acid residues cannot be easily observed in 1D proton spectra, while their signals are well resolved in the 2D HSQC spectra. The possibility to use the HSQC spectra, not only to assign 1D superimposed proton signals but also to quantify the relative abundance of each residue of glycosaminoglycans, was recently proposed by different groups (17,18). These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants.

      "One Paragraph of [10. CONCLUSION]: Even if 2D HSQC would be preferable in terms of amount of information obtained, the need for instruments equipped with high sensitivity probes (for example, cryogenically cooled probes) and for operators skilled in NMR, will make the application of the HSQC method difficult for many analytical laboratories. Although lower resolution and containing less information than 2D data sets, 1D proton-NMR data can be used to distinguish heparin types in a facile manner and is very similar to a method that is already required by several pharmacopeias and more widely applicable to an analytical laboratory. However, the increasing sensitivity and accuracy of NMR spectrometers and the availability of software which allows the complete automatization of the spectra processing and analysis have made the HSQC methodology a viable information value added alternative for many laboratories and may become more widely accessible in the future.\n",

In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M.\n",

SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECEPTORS 1-3]: In contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2).

An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5).

Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6).

The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis.

      "One Paragraph of [6. CONCLUSION]: The present results demonstrate that macrocyclic bi-bracchial 1,8-naphthyridine receptor 2 is capable of binding and recognizing monosaccharide substrates in water through multiple noncovalent interactions. The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes .
