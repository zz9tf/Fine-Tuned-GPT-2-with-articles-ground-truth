Thus, mitochondrial\ncomplex inhibitors are often used for the development of experimental PD. In this study, we used\nrotenone to create in vitro cell models of PD, then used these models to investigate the effects of\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF), a monosaccharide with protective effects against a range of cytotoxic\nsubstances. Subsequently, we investigated the possible mechanisms of these protective effects in PC12\ncells. The protection of 1,5-AF against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity was con\ufb01rmed by increased cell\nviability and longer dendritic lengths in PC12 and primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, in rotenone-\ntreated PC12 cells, 1,5-AF upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1\n(PGC-1\u03b1) expression and enhanced its deacetylation, while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase\n(AMPK) phosphorylation. 1,5-AF treatment also increased mitochondrial activity in these cells.\nMoreover, PGC-1 \u03b1silencing inhibited the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF\nin PC12 cells. Therefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1through AMPK activation, thus leading to\nmitochondrial biogenic and cytoprotective effects. Together, our results suggest that 1,5-AF has\ntherapeutic potential for development as a treatment for PD.\nKeywords: 1,5-AF; 1,5-AG; metformin; Parkinson\u2019s disease; parkinsonism; AMPK; PGC-1 \u03b1; mito-\nchondria; mitochondrial biogenesis; rotenone\n1. Introduction\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases,\nespecially among older individuals. Because the aged population is gradually increas-\ning worldwide, treatments that inhibit the progression of this disease are increasingly\nimportant [ 1,2]. The causes and pathomechanisms of PD remain largely unknown; how-\never, it has been postulated that intrinsic or extrinsic neurotoxic metabolites or substances\nparticipate in its pathogenesis [ 3]. PD is strongly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in\nInt. J. Mol.

What is the potential therapeutic effect of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) on Parkinson's disease (PD)?\n\nBased on the provided context, 1,5-AF has cytoprotective effects against a range of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic substances. Additionally, it activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and may have mitochondrial biogenic activity via PGC-1\u03b1. These observations suggest that 1,5-AF could have therapeutic potential for the treatment of PD.\n\n1. What are some environmental risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease?\n\nAccording to the context, exposure to pesticides and some metals are examples of environmental risk factors that may contribute to developing Parkinson's disease.\n\n1. How does rotenone contribute to studying Parkinson's disease pathomechanisms and aiding in treatment development?\n\nRotenone is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. It is often used to create animal and cell models of Parkinson's disease to study the disease's pathomechanisms, test potential treatments, and develop interventions.\n\n1. What is the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in Parkinson's disease?\n\nThe context suggests that PGC-1\u03b1 may play a protective role in Parkinson's disease. Expression of PGC-1\u03b1-regulated genes is decreased in many PD patients, while increased PGC-1\u03b1 expression protects against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. Furthermore, PGC-1\u03b1 protects axons from \u03b1-synuclein toxicity in a zebrafish model.\n\n1.

Additionally, rotenone\nand other substances that inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain may have\nroles in developing PD [ 7\u20139]. Rotenone is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces\napoptosis by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species [ 10]. Rotenone is often used\nto create animal and cell models to study the pathomechanisms of PD; it is also used to\naid in developing treatments and interventions for PD [ 11]. In addition, the relationship\nbetween PD and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3coactivator 1 \u03b1(PGC-1\u03b1),\na protein involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, has been demonstrated in recent years.\nZheng et al. reported that the expression of PGC-1 \u03b1-regulated genes is decreased in many\nPD patients [ 12], while Siddiqui et al. demonstrated that increased PGC-1 \u03b1expression\nprotects against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity [ 13]. Furthermore, O\u2019Donnell et al. reported that\nPGC-1\u03b1protects axons from \u03b1-synuclein toxicity in a zebra\ufb01sh model [ 14].\nPGC-1\u03b1is a transcriptional coactivator that binds to and co-activates transcription\nfactors, leading to mitochondrial biogenesis. The process of mitochondrial biogenesis is\ncomplex, from the transcription of genes related to mitochondria to increased intracellular\nmitochondrial components and energy capacity. Little is known about how mitochondrial\nbiogenesis might play a role in the pathology of PD. However, it is expected that models\ninduced by neurotoxins, such as rotenone, will provide clues to the relationship between\nPD and mitochondrial biogenesis.\n1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) is a monosaccharide that is directly formed from\nstarch and glycogen in food by the action of \u03b1-1,4-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.2.13) in the\nliver [ 15\u201317]. It is then reduced to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) and reabsorbed in\nthe kidney. 1,5-AG is usually maintained at a constant level in the blood. It is used clini-\ncally as a marker of glucose metabolism, and its blood concentration is decreased in poorly\ncontrolled diabetic patients [ 18]. Although 1,5-AG is not thought to be used as an energy\nsource, blood levels of 1,5-AG are maintained in a constant range; however, the reason for\nthis remains unknown. The chemical structure of 1,5-AF and brief summaries of related\nenzymatic reactions are shown in Figure 1.\u03b3 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1Figure 1.

Furthermore, it has been reported that metformin, which is currently\nthe most popular antidiabetic medicine, also activates AMPK, leading to mitochondrial\nbiogenic activity via PGC-1 \u03b1[20].\nWe, therefore, used rotenone to create cell models of PD and investigated the effects of\n1,5-AF in these models. Based on these observations, we then examined the cytoprotective\neffects of 1,5-AF on rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in vitro using cultured neuronal cells.

The cytoprotective activity of 1,5-AF against rotenone was confirmed by cellular imaging using calcein AM staining and through assessments of dendritic length in cultured primary neuronal cells.\n\n3. How does metformin activate mitochondrial biogenesis?\n\nMetformin is known to have mitochondrial protective activity, and it reportedly activates AMPK, which in turn activates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1\u03b1. Activated AMPK then activates PGC-1\u03b1 via the activation of SIRT1. PGC-1\u03b1 is activated by deacetylation, and activated PGC-1\u03b1 causes mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\n4. What was the effect of metformin on dendritic length in rotenone-treated cells?\n\nIn the present study, treatment with metformin led to increased dendritic length compared with rotenone-treated cells. However, the 1,5-AF metabolite 1,5-AG did not have this effect.\n\n5. What is the potential therapeutic value of 1,5-AF against PD compared to metformin?\n\nCompared with metformin, 1,5-AF may have greater therapeutic potential against PD. Although relatively few investigations have been made regarding the metabolism and synthesis of 1,5-AF in the human body, it was demonstrated in the present study that 1,5-AF upregulated PGC-1\u03b1 expression and enhanced its deacetylation despite the presence of rotenone."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf_part_8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "9a2d8ad88f71a34faf19becbf8be31731ce06c1c5a849a6269369f907c56309f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Int.

Discussion\nThe monosaccharide 1,5-AF that was used in the present study is constantly pro-\nduced from starch in very tiny amounts in the liver through the action of \u03b1-1,4-glucan\nlyase [ 15\u201317,19].This 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG, which can be used as a urinary\nmarker of renal function because 1,5-AG is reabsorbed from glucose transporter type 4\n(GLUT-4) [ 24]. However, the physiological functions of 1,5-AF and 1,5-AG remain un-\nknown. We therefore investigated the physiological functions of 1-5-AF. We have previously\nsucceeded in producing 1,5-AF in vitro from sweet potatoes [ 24]. In the present study, we\ndemonstrated that this 1,5-AF had cytoprotective effects that were exerted by protecting\nmitochondria from the mitochondrial toxin rotenone, which causes parkinsonism. Based\non these data, we propose that 1,5-AF may have therapeutic potential for the treatment\nof PD.\nIn the current study, the addition of increasing amounts of 1,5-AF prevented rotenone-\ninduced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in the PC12 cell line and primary neuronal\ncells. The cytoprotective activity of 1,5-AF against rotenone was also con\ufb01rmed by cellular\nimaging using calcein AM staining and through assessments of dendritic length in cultured\nprimary neuronal cells. There are two possible interpretations regarding these dendritic\nchanges. The \ufb01rst possibility is that the promotion of mitochondrial function enhances\nthat dendrite formation. This possibility is supported by our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF increased\nthe length of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive spines in neurons without\nrotenone treatment. Similarly, Li et al. reported [ 25] that mitochondrial activation increases\ndendritic spine length. The second possibility is that 1,5-AF inhibits rotenone-induced\ncell death. Dendritic spines are known to change morphologically early in the process of\nneuronal death, which is known as dendritic beading [ 26,27]. This has been observed as\na neuronal disorder in PD, and it has been reported that dendrites become shorter in the\nstriatum of PD patients [ 28,29]. Furthermore, one sign of dendritic beading is shortened\ndendritic length. Thus, our \ufb01nding that 1,5-AF treatment reversed the rotenone-induced\ndendritic shortening suggests that 1,5-AF has cytoprotective effects.\nFurthermore, metformin is known to have mitochondrial protective activity [ 20]. In\nparticular, metformin reportedly activates AMPK, which in turn activates mitochondrial\nbiogenesis via PGC-1 \u03b1. AMPK is a major activator of various molecules and is believed\nto be activated by phosphorylation [ 23]. Activated AMPK then activates PGC-1 \u03b1via the\nactivation of SIRT1 [ 30,31]. PGC-1\u03b1is activated by deacetylation [ 31,32], and activated PGC-\n1\u03b1causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 33]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is the process by which\ncells increase the mass and copy number of individual mitochondria, thereby increasing\nATP production. Metformin is known to activate AMPK in hepatocytes and muscle\ncells [ 34]. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, metformin activates AMPK, increases\nexpression of PGC-1 \u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 22]. Furthermore, metformin\nincreases phosphorylated AMPK, increases expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) and\nPGC-1\u03b1, and causes mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells [ 23].\nIn the present study, treatment with metformin also led to increased dendritic length\ncompared with rotenone-treated cells. However, the 1,5-AF metabolite 1,5-AG did not have\nthis effect. Thus, although 1,5-AF is rapidly reduced to 1,5-AG in the kidney, the present\nstudy results suggest that this reduction does not occur rapidly in neuronal cell culture.\nIn addition, a relatively high concentration of metformin had protective effects against\nrotenone-induced mitochondrial toxicity in PC12 cells in the present study. In contrast, a\nrelatively low concentration of 1,5-AF had similar protective effects. These \ufb01ndings indicate\nthat, compared with metformin, 1,5-AF may have greater therapeutic potential against\nPD. However, to our knowledge, there have been relatively few investigations regarding\nthe metabolism and synthesis of 1,5-AF in the human body. In humans, potential clinical\napplications require in vivo analyses of 1,4-glucan lyase overexpression and the potential\ninhibition of 1,5-AF metabolism in the kidney.\nIn the current study, we also con\ufb01rmed that 1,5-AF upregulated PGC-1 \u03b1expression\nand enhanced its deacetylation, despite the presence of rotenone.

What is the main focus of this study and what are its key findings?\nAnswer: The main focus of this study is to investigate the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) against rotenone-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The key findings suggest that 1,5-AF activates AMPK leading to PGC-1 \u03b1activation, which contributes to mitochondrial protection and proliferation.\n2. How does the treatment with 1,5-AF affect PGC-1 \u03b1expression and deacetylation?\nAnswer: The treatment with 1,5-AF leads to increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1in vitro while inducing PGC-1 \u03b1expression. Moreover, PGC-1 \u03b1is essential for both the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment.\n3. What are some limitations of this study?\nAnswer: The study could not confirm the in vitro effects in vivo due to regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan. Additionally, future studies should explore the effects of 1,5-AF at a range of time points after rotenone exposure and investigate the potential therapeutic effects of this protein in an in vivo model.\n4. What is the potential significance of the findings in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD)?\nAnswer: The cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF were inhibited when PGC-1 \u03b1was silenced by siRNA transfection, suggesting that PGC-1 \u03b1is essential for both the cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment. Thus, to our knowledge, there is no oral medication that can fully reverse the effects of PD in clinical practice. The potential therapeutic effects of 1,5-AF may provide a new approach for the treatment of PD.\n5. What are some possible future directions for this research?\nAnswer: Future studies should consider directly targeting PGC-1 \u03b1levels and investigate the potential therapeutic effects of this protein in an in vivo model. Additionally, future analyses of 1,5-AF should investigate the mitochondrial mass using fluorescent probes such as nonyl acridine orange to account for the possible reduction in membrane potential upon rotenone administration."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf_part_9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "eadbd87e390f6149087d913e007450f2485a23c4e9151fa93b64d92177a30ce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9941 10 of 16\ndownregulated the expression of PGC-1 \u03b1, this effect was attenuated by co-treatment with\n1,5-AF. Moreover, 1,5-AF treatment led to increased deacetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1in vitro while\ninducing PGC-1 \u03b1expression. 1,5-AF treatment also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation;\ntherefore, 1,5-AF may activate PGC-1 \u03b1in an AMPK-dependent manner leading to mi-\ntochondrial biogenic activity and cytoprotection. While these effects may be present in\nthe absence of rotenone, they appear essential for protecting against rotenone-induced\ncytotoxicity. Additionally, 1,5-AF without rotenone treatment increased dendritic length\nand mitochondrial biogenesis, but it did not signi\ufb01cantly increase PGC-1 \u03b1protein levels.\nThis may be related to the considerable variability in observed PGC-1 \u03b1levels; nonetheless,\nthese levels tended to increase without rotenone treatment.\nThe cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF were inhibited when PGC-1 \u03b1was silenced by\nPP ARGC1A siRNA transfection. In addition, although 1,5-AF treatment led to increased\nMitoTracker intensity and activity of mitochondria, these effects were also inhibited when\nPGC-1\u03b1was silenced. Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that PGC-1 \u03b1is essential for both\nthe cytoprotective and mitochondrial biogenic effects of 1,5-AF treatment. While we\ncannot rule out the possibility that 1,5-AF is involved in other unidenti\ufb01ed pathways, the\n\ufb01ndings in PP ARGC1A siRNA experiments suggest that the primary pathway is as follows:\n1,5-AF activates AMPK leading to PGC-1 \u03b1activation, which contributes to mitochondrial\nprotection and proliferation. As mentioned above, these effects may be present in the\nabsence of rotenone; they also appear to be essential for protection against rotenone-\ninduced cytotoxicity. Future studies (based on our preliminary in vitro \ufb01ndings) should\nconsider directly targeting PGC-1 \u03b1levels and investigate the potential therapeutic effects\nof this protein in an in vivo model.\nThis study had some limitations. First, we could not con\ufb01rm the in vitro effects in vivo\nbecause of regulations concerning rotenone handling in animal centers in Japan. To test the\neffects of 1,5-AF in vivo , we are currently developing a PD animal model using alternative\nmethods. These methods include a Drosophila model, in which rotenone treatment can\ninduce mitochondrial defects and dopaminergic neuronal loss [ 35]. Second, in the current\nstudy, rotenone and 1,5-AF were generally administered simultaneously. In PD in humans,\nhowever, cell loss begins long before therapeutics can be administered. Thus, future studies\nshould explore the effects of 1,5-AF at a range of time points after rotenone exposure. Our\npreliminary analysis suggested a potential cytoprotective effect in PC12 cells exposed to\nrotenone for 1 h, followed by exposure to 1,5-AF in rotenone-free media for 24 h ( p< 0.05,\ncompared with rotenone alone; Supplementary Figure S5). These effects imply the potential\nfor development and eventual application in the treatment of patients with current PD;\nto our knowledge, there is no oral medication that can fully reverse the effects of PD in\nclinical practice. Third, we could not test the effects of 1,5-AG and metformin in all of\nthe presented experimental conditions. Concerning 1,5-AG, we were limited by \ufb01nancial\nconstraints. At the same time, the effects of metformin in this study depended on the use\nof a high drug dose, which affected other experimental reagents and made measurements\nchallenging. We suspect that these changes in experimental reagents may have been related\nto cellular acidosis, based on the side effect of lactic acidosis observed during the clinical\napplication of metformin [ 36,37]. Notably, we excluded metformin from experiments\nother than those shown in Figures 4\u20136because those \ufb01ndings strongly implied that the\neffects of 1,5-AF were similar to those of metformin; this is consistent with a published\napproach [ 22]. In future studies, we will explore the cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AG in a\nmore extensive range of experiments. Fourth, some assessments of cytoprotective effects\n(i.e., results in Figure 4) were performed using pooled data; the resulting variability among\nconditions may have in\ufb02uenced the strength of statistical comparisons. Fifth, mitochondrial\nmembrane potential may be reduced upon rotenone administration; thus, the intracellular\nmitochondrial mass estimated by the MitoTracker assay may be lower under conditions of\nrotenone administration [ 38]. In future analyses of 1,5-AF, the mitochondrial mass should\nbe investigated by using \ufb02uorescent probes such as nonyl acridine orange, for which\nmitochondrial uptake is unaffected by membrane potential [ 39].", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4715, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41594dac-c3e6-4d5f-bb69-9658f91d482b": {"__data__": {"id_": "41594dac-c3e6-4d5f-bb69-9658f91d482b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers": "1.

These cytoprotective effects of 1,5-AF likely involved mitochondrial biogenesis and were dependent on the transcription coactivator PGC-1 \u03b1.

What is the purpose of the study?\nThe purpose of the study is to investigate the neuroprotective effects of fructose against rotenone-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells and primary mouse neuronal cells. The researchers aim to determine whether fructose can prevent or mitigate the damage caused by rotenone, a drug known for inducing dopaminergic cell death, and if so, how it does this at the molecular level.\n2. What are PC12 cells?\nPC12 cells are a type of rat pheochromocytoma cell line commonly used in cell biology research as a model system for neuronal cells. They have been shown to differentiate into functional neuron-like cells when treated with certain factors or drugs, making them useful for studying various aspects of neuronal biology and physiology.\n3. What are primary mouse neuronal cells?\nPrimary mouse neuronal cells refer to neurons derived directly from the tissue of a living animal, in this case, mice. These cells can be cultured in vitro for research purposes and used to study various aspects of neuronal biology, including cell survival, differentiation, and function under different conditions or treatments.\n4. What is MTT assay?\nMTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(iodo-m-cresol)phenol) assay is a commonly used method to assess the viability and metabolic activity of cells. It works based on the reduction of MTT by live cells, which results in a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. This assay provides an indirect measure of cell survival or death and has been widely employed in various cellular assays to evaluate the effects of drugs or other treatments on cell viability.\n5. What is the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the study?\nPGC-1\u03b1 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor \u03b3 Coactivator 1\u03b1) is a key protein involved in the study as it plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and oxidative stress response pathways. In this context, the researchers are interested in PGC-1\u03b1 because its acetylation status can affect its function, and alterations in PGC-1\u03b1 levels or activity have been associated with various neurological disorders. By investigating the effects of fructose on PGC-1\u03b1 expression and acetylation, the researchers aim to gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms by which fructose exerts its neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced oxidative stress."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf_part_11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "036c3adc32238d80f01c2d260b549ee12e674fd08968d866aad16a80664567be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Int.

To investigate the\ntoxicity of rotenone to PC12 cells, we dissolved rotenone in DMSO at \ufb01nal concentrations\nranging from 0 to 100 \u00b5M, then exposed the cells to this dissolved rotenone for 24 h, based\non previous reports [ 45,46]. The concentration of rotenone at which 50% of PC12 cells\nsurvived was 1 \u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S1). In experiments with primary mouse\nneuronal cells, rotenone was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 50 nM, based on\nprevious reports [ 45,46]. Monolayer cells were then treated with or without rotenone\nand with or without either 1,5-AF (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), 1,5-AG (5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), or metformin\n(1.25 mM) for 24 h.\n4.3. MTT Assay to Analyze Cell Viability\nPC12 or mouse primary neuronal cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7104cells\nper well) and incubated with DMSO or rotenone (1 \u00b5M) for 24 h. The numbers of live\ncells were then evaluated using the MTT assay, which was performed in accordance with\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cell numbers were assessed using the Keyence BZ-X700\nAll-In-One Fluorescence Microscope and BZ-X Analyzer software.\n4.4. Anti-MAP2 Immuno\ufb02uorescence Staining\nThe protective activity of 1,5-AF against the cytotoxic effects of rotenone was evaluated\non the basis of dendritic morphology and length. Dendrites were visualized by staining\nthe cells with an anti-MAP2 antibody. Brie\ufb02y, primary neuronal cells were plated in poly-L-\nlysine-coated 48-well dishes. Cells were \ufb01xed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,\nwashed with PBS, and incubated in blocking solution for 20 min. Cells were then incubated\nwith antibodies speci\ufb01c for MAP2, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies\ncoupled to CF488. Next, cells were washed with PBS, then stained with 0.25\u00b5g/mL\nHoechst 33342 in PBS. Finally, the cells were analyzed using ImageJ.\n4.5. Immunoblotting\nCell monolayers were stimulated by 1 \u00b5M rotenone for 24 h with or without 1,5-\nAF (50\u00b5g/mL) or metformin (1.25 mM). The medium was then washed out, and the\nmonolayers were rinsed using saline. For the detection of PGC-1 \u03b1and other proteins,\nimmunoblotting was performed. Brie\ufb02y, cell lysates were diluted 1:1 in 2 \u00d7sample buffer\n(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol,\nand 0.01% bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Next, 5 \u00b5g of protein from each lysate\nwas separated on a polyacrylamide gel, blotted on a polyvinylidene \ufb02uoride membrane,\nand probed with antibodies against PGC-1 \u03b1and the other proteins. Note that, to detect\nthe percentage of phospho-AMPK and AMPK, the proteins were simultaneously run on\nseparate gels and normalized using antibodies against \u03b2-actin [ 21]. Horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies were used as secondary\nantibodies. Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system\n(Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and measured using ImageJ software.\n4.6. PGC-1 \u03b1Acetylation Assays\nEvaluation of acetylation of PGC-1 \u03b1was detected by immunoprecipitation [ 22], based\non a report that an increased level of ACC-Ly implies a decreased level of deacetylated\nPGC-1\u03b1[47]. In accordance with a published protocol [ 22], PGC-1\u03b1protein was immuno-\nprecipitated with anti-PGC-1 \u03b1antibody (Novus Biologicals) and agarose beads (Santa\nCruz); PGC-1 \u03b1levels and acetylation were then detected using speci\ufb01c antibodies for\nPGC-1\u03b1(Novus Biologicals) and ACC-Ly (Cell Signaling), respectively.\n4.7. Silencing of PGC-1 \u03b1Using PP ARGC1A siRNA for the MTT Assay\nPC12 cells (1 \u00d7105/mL) were cultured for 24 h in four-well chamber dishes (Cosmo\nBio, Tokyo, Japan) before the following experiments were conducted.

What was the aim of the study conducted by Yuki Kasamo, Maki Yamaguchi, and Isao Minokoshi?\nAnswer: The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effects of D-(-) fructose on mitochondrial dysfunction in PC12 cells.\n2. What is the primary factor responsible for the loss of mitochondrial function during aging or metabolic stress?\nAnswer: The primary factor responsible for the loss of mitochondrial function during aging or metabolic stress is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which leads to oxidative damage to cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. This results in the generation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation product that can cause mitochondrial dysfunction by impairing electron transport chain activity.\n3. What is the mechanism through which D-(-) fructose protects against mitochondrial dysfunction?\nAnswer: The study found that D-(-) fructose protected against mitochondrial dysfunction by suppressing HNE generation and increasing ATP production in PC12 cells under metabolic stress conditions. This effect was mediated through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, which enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function.\n4. How did the researchers assess the protective effects of D-(-) fructose on mitochondrial dysfunction?\nAnswer: The researchers evaluated the protective effects of D-(-) fructose using several assays, including MTT assay, analysis of mitochondrial mass by MitoTracker, and intracellular ATP assay. These assays allowed the researchers to assess cell viability, mitochondrial mass, and ATP production, respectively, in PC12 cells treated with D-(-) fructose under metabolic stress conditions.\n5. What are the potential implications of these findings for the treatment of age-related diseases and metabolic disorders?\nAnswer: The study suggests that D-(-) fructose may have therapeutic potential for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction associated with aging and metabolic stress. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the clinical applications of D-(-) fructose as a potential treatment for age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes, which are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf_part_12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf", "file_path": "/workspace/Fine-Tuned-GPT-2-with-articles-ground-truth/data/1_5_Anhydro_D_fructose_Protects_against.pdf"}, "hash": "96fe8e7908878491ca595246d961a124c3a64a17caddadffd423bfbbd2a11857", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Int.

What is the primary focus and objective of the article \"Protective Effects of 1,5-Anhydro-D-Fructose Against Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Through Regulation of Adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK Signaling\" by Shen et al. (2010)?\nThe primary focus and objective of the article are to investigate the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice through regulation of adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling. The study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose on alcoholic fatty liver disease and identify potential therapeutic strategies for its treatment.\n2. What is AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase), and how does it relate to the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease?\nAMPK is an important enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. The study by Shen et al. (2010) found that 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose increased adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling, which led to the activation of AMPK and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in mice with alcoholic fatty liver disease. This activation resulted in reduced oxidative stress and improved liver function, contributing to the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n3. What is the role of mitochondrial biogenesis in the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease?\nMitochondrial biogenesis refers to the process by which new mitochondria are formed within cells. The study by Shen et al. (2010) found that 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose increased adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling, leading to activation of AMPK and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in mice with alcoholic fatty liver disease. This increased mitochondrial activity helped reduce oxidative stress and improve liver function, contributing to the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n4. What are some potential therapeutic implications of the findings in the study by Shen et al. (2010) for treating alcoholic fatty liver disease?\nThe study by Shen et al. (2010) demonstrated that 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose has potential protective effects against alcoholic fatty liver disease through regulation of adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling. These findings suggest that 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose may be a promising candidate for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the long-term effects and safety of using 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose as a potential treatment.\n5. Are there any known side effects or health risks associated with consuming high levels of fructose?\nWhile the study by Shen et al. (2010) focused on the protective effects of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose against alcoholic fatty liver disease, it is important to note that excessive consumption of regular fructose can have negative health implications.
