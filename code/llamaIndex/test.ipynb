       " 'Experimental': 'Capsaicin (≥ 95%), D-glucosamine hydrochloride (≥ 99 %) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (≥ 95 %) were supplied from Aldrich, and were confirmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR. All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag ™ . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 ºC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 ºC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na₂CO₂ and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22]. The variation of pD was less than ±0.02 in every titration run. Volume changes due to addition of aliquots were corrected in calculation process.

Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The δ values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that δ observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\\nHere δ as is the δ inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, δ ua is δ of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry δ ua identical with that of monomeric molecule.

Since the coexisting isomers, α-Gl 0 and β-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually:\\nIn these expressions, [αGl 0 Cp] and [βGl 0 Cp] are the molar concentrations of capsaicin complexes with α-Gl 0 and β-Gl 0 , respectively.

Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field . Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field [24,38,39]. The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall δ values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table . The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall δ values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3).

In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

       " 'Complexation of N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin': 'The complexation of N-acetylglucosamine was studied at pD 9.55 for comparison with glucosamine, although the former is not protonated in the ordinary pH range [40]; at pD 6.55, the solubility of capsaicin was too low for titrations. In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1´) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1´) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure ). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure S6 in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table  in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table S3).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .',\n",
       " 'Conclusion': 'Protonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the α-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the β-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the α-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither α nor β form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups. This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.

The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin. This selective interaction is much more pronounced in basic media in which glucosamine is not protonated.',\n",

Alternate curve fittings were carried out repeatedly on a pair of titration curves of α and β forms as follows. The first least-squares calculation was executed for jα by assuming K fβ = 0; the resulting K fα is the formation constant for virtual non-competitive complexation. This value was employed for K fα in the least-squares fitting of jβ , and the obtained K fβ was used in the next least-squares fitting of jα . These alternate fittings were repeated until convergence in the parameters. The consistency was confirmed by changing the order of least-squares calculations for jα and jβ . These least- [39] C.
