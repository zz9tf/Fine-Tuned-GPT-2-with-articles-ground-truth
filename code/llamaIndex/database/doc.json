Introduction \nA wealth of information on brain metabolism has been gathered from studies in which 13C-\nlabeled metabolic substrates (often glucose) ha ve been administered to human subjects or \nexperimental animals. 13C Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS1) of the brain (or extracts \nof brain) has shown to what degree the 13C-labeled compound has been metabolized, and, to \nsome extent, along which metabolic pathways. Th e latter interpretation derives from the fact \nthat 13C MRS shows the 13C labeling not of individual compounds, e.g. amino acids, but of \nindividual carbon positions in those different  compounds (Fig. 1). Because some enzymes of \namino acid metabolism have a cell-specific expr ession, it is possible to study the metabolic \nactivity of individual cell ty pes or the transfer of amin o acids between them. Finally, 13C \nMRS allows studies of a host of substrates to examine their potential as metabolic substrates \nfor the brain. An extensive review, which incl uded an overview of technical aspects of 13C \nMRS in studies of brain and cultured brain cells , appeared recently (Rodrigues et al., 2009). \n2. 13C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism \nGlucose is considered the physiologic energy su bstrate of the brain and is used by all brain \ncells, neurons and glial cells alike. Glucose co nsumption is tightly coupled to the need for \nenergy (ATP), which in the brain largely reflec ts neuronal activity, or more specifically, \ndepolarization of neuronal cell membranes. The membrane potential derives from the ionic \ngradients created by ion pumps that tran sport sodium and pota ssium against their \nconcentration gradients across cell membranes, an activity that is fuelled by ATP (Attwell \nand Laughlin, 2001). Therefore, al terations in neuronal activity  will be reflected in changes \nin glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and \noxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13C MRS after administration of 13C-labeled glucose to \n                                                 \n1 Abbreviations:ATP: adenosine triphosphate, CoA: coenzyme A, GABA: \uf067-aminobutyrate, i.v. \nintravenously, MRS: magnetic resonance spectroscopy , PET; positron emission tomography, TCA cycle: \ntricarboxylic acid cycle. \nwww.intechopen.com",

                "text": " \nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy \n 30\nhuman volunteers or to experimental animals is  well suited to investigate the relationship \nbetween neuronal activity, energy requirements , and glucose metabolism, because several of \nthe downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, \naspartate \u2013 see Fig. 1)  can be detected by 13C MRS. \n \nFig. 1. 13C MR spectrum of a brain extract from  a mouse that received 150 \u00b5mol [U- 13C] \nglucose intravenously in the awake state and wa s sacrificed after 5 minutes. Peak numbers: \n1, lactate C3; 2, glutamate C4; 3, GABA C2; 4, glutamine C4, 5, aspartate C3, 6: lactate C2; 7, \nalanine C3, 8: glutamate C3, which is labeled af ter a full turn of th e TCA cycle. *Internal \nstandard (dioxane). Note the strong 13C labeling of glutamate C4 and lactate C3 from [U-\n13C]glucose. Reprinted from Nguyen et al., 2003, with permission from the publisher. \nAdministration of 13C-labeled glucose intravenously (i.v.) or intraperitoneally leads to \npredominant labeling of glutamate in the brain (F igs. 1 and 2). This is so, because glutamate \nis present in concentrations that allow detection by 13C MRS, and because virtually all \nglucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized \noxidatively. Briefly, 13C-glucose is metabolized to 13C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with \noxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1st and 2nd carbons of citrate, which \ncorrespond to the 5th and 4th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. 2). \nLogically, these two positions are the first to be  labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly \nlabeled glucose, [U-13C]glucose is being used. If [1-13C]glucose is used, which is often the case, \nthe 2nd position of acetyl-CoA beco mes labeled, and hence the 4th position of glutamate (e.g. \nFitzpatrick et al., 1990; Shank et al., 1993;  Mason et al., 1999; see Figs. 1 and 2).  \nHowever, when \u03b1-ketoglutarate is metabolized further through the TCA cycle, succinate is \nformed. Succinate has four carbon atoms and is symmetrical, so the label is now scrambl ed \nbetween the 1st + 2nd positions and the 3rd + 4th positions (or the 2nd and 3rd positions if [1-\n13C]glucose is being used). From succinate fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate are formed \nbefore another molecule of acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form ci trate. The labeling of \nthe 2nd and 3rd positions in succinate, fumarate, mala te, and oxaloacetate correspond to the \n2nd and 3rd positions in glutamate. Labeling of thes e positions in glutamate reflects passage \nof 13C through the TCA cycle (Fig. 1 and 2). From the labeling of the 2nd and 3rd vs. the 4th \npositions in glutamate from [1-13C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be \ngained, or the rate may even be calculated (Hassel et al., 1995a; 1997; Mason et al., 1999; \nHyder et al., 2003). \nwww.intechopen.com",

Simplified scheme of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Glucose is metabolized \nglycolytically to pyruvate, which may un dergo decarboxylation in the pyruvate \ndehydrogenase reaction to become acetyl-C oA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to \ncondense with oxaloacetate (OAA) and form ci trate. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA that \ncontribute to citrate (and hence \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA) are \nshown in italics. Due to the symmetry of succ inate these two carbons are distributed evenly \nbetween the C1+C2 positions and the C3+C4 posi tions in succinate and in fumarate, malate \nand oxaloacetate, which are formed downstream  of succinate. Pyruvate may also become \naminated to alanine or  reduced to lactate. \nOxaloacetate equilibrates with aspartate, and whereas oxaloacetate at a tissue concentration \nof ~10 \uf020nmol/g brain tissue (Siesj\u00f6, 1978) defies detection by 13C MRS, aspartate is readily \ndetected, especially its 2nd and 3rd carbon positions, the labeling  of which reflects the passage \nof 13C through the TCA cycle (Figs. 1 and 2). It has been shown with various techniques that \naspartate is concentrated in  GABAergic neurons (Ottersen and Storm-Mathisen, 1985; \nHassel et al., 1992; 1995b). With 13C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of \nGABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13C labeling of \naspartate from [1-13C]glucose (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a; Johannessen et al., 2001). \nInhibition of TCA cycle activity by drugs or toxins may reduce the 13C labeling of glutamate, \nGABA, or glutamine from [13C]glucose (e.g. Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a).

Ther efore, a reduction in the labeling of \ncerebral metabolites from [13C]glucose must be interpreted with some caution. Such a \nreduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for \ninstance through enzyme inhibition.  \nConversely, any influence that leads to incr eased activation of the brain may increase \nglucose metabolism and increase 13C labeling from [13C]glucose. Such effects have been seen \nin human subjects and in rats (Hyder et al.,  1996; Patel et al., 2004). However, it should be \nnoted that although previous studies on a variety of experimentally induced conditions, \nincluding epileptic seizures and stroke, ha ve shown increased uptake of the glucose \nanalogue deoxyglucose by  positron emissi on tomography (PET) or autoradiographic \nmethods, data obtained with 13C MRS seem to indicate that the oxidative metabolism of \nglucose may be only little affected or even redu ced (Petroff et al., 2002; Eloqayli et al., 2004; \nNguyen et al., 2007a; Pan et al., 2008; H\u00e5berg et al., 2009). The same is true for other \nconditions that would be expected to enta il an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic \nbrain injury (Bartnik et al., 2007; Scafidi et al., 2009). Deoxyglucose is a substrate for the \nglucose transporter in the blood-brain barrier an d in neurons, as well as for the first enzyme \nof glucose metabolism, hexokinase, which phopsphorylates glucose and deoxygl ucose to \ntheir 6-phospho- derivatives. But once phophorylated deoxyglucose is not metabo lized \nfurther and accumulates intracellularly; this a llows its detection by PET or autoradiography. \nIt follows that the deoxyglucose-based method s strictly detect the transport and initial \nphosphorylation of deoxyglucose, whereas 13C MRS detection of glutamate labeling from \n[13C]glucose reflects both glycolytic and oxid ative metabolic activity in the brain.  \nThe possibility of visualizing brain energy meta bolism appeared to pave the way for studies \nin which brain activity, including sensory ac tivation and thought processes, could be \nmonitored by 13C MRS. It soon became clear, howe ver, that the increase in glucose \nmetabolism caused by various forms of physio logical activation, was quite small, and not \nalways readily detectable on the background of a high basal metabolic rate in the un-\nanesthetized brain (Shu lman et al., 2004).  \n3. Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocy tes and neurons \nThe cellular complexity of the brain makes it difficult to assess the metabolic activity of \nindividual cell types separately. However, because some metabolic pathways are unique to \ncertain cells, and because some metabolic substrates are metabolized selectively by certain \ncell types, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible. Fi rst we \nconsider the transfer of glutamine from astroc ytes to neurons as a precursor for glutamate \nand GABA in neurons. Thereafter we discuss the transfer of glutamate from neurons to \nastrocytes during glutamat ergic neurotransmission.  \nIn the brain, acetate is metabolized oxidativel y by astrocytes and not by neurons. Because \nastrocytes express glutamine synthetase (Mar tinez-Hernandez et al., 1977), isotopically \nlabeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) le ads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van \nden Berg et al., 1969; Hassel et al., 1997; Lebon et al., 2002; Deelchand et al., 2009). Glutamine \nis exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, \nboth glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to \nglutamate by phosphate-activated glutamin ase (Kvamme et al., 2001), a mitochondrial \nenzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons.

Waniewski and Martin (1998) provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the \ncell membrane only in astrocytes. This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small \nmonocarboxylate, for which neurons are rich ly equipped with transporters (Bergersen, \n2007). Nguyen et al (2007b) later found that neur ons take up propionate (which is closely \nrelated to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by \nneurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in \nbrain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading \nenzyme GABA transaminase (Hassel et al., unpublished). GABA transaminase is an \nintramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neuron s (Schousboe et al., 1974), and its inhibition \nby a small monocarboxylate such as propionate su ggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken \nup by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that  the latter are deficient in the enzyme that \nconverts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives.  \nBecause glutamate is readily labeled from 13C-labeled precursors, there has been \nconsiderable interest in identifying transmitter glutamate with 13C MRS. Glutamate is the \nmain excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves \nmany functions in the brain, it has been esti mated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain \nglutamate serves a neurotrans mitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006). After release \nfrom synaptic nerve endings glutamate is larg ely taken up by astrocytes that surround the \nsynaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine (Danbolt, 2001). This process may be illustrated \nwith 13C MRS. Administration of 13C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid \n13C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a \nlarge extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) tr ansmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was \nshown in an experiment in which mice had thei r astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the glia-\nspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate (Hassel et al., 1997). The mice could not form \nglutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13C-\nglutamine from 13C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13C-glucose was interpreted to \nreflect formation of 13C-glutamate from 13C-glucose in neurons, release of 13C-labeled \ntransmitter glutamate from neurons, upta ke into astrocytes of the released 13C-labeled \ntransmitter glutamate and subsequent amid ation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 4). \nThe exchange between neurons and astrocytes  of glutamate and glutamine has been the \nsubject of many studies, in both human subjects  and experimental animals (Shen et al., 1999; \nsee Rothman et al., 1999; 2003, for review). Interpretation of 13C MRS after infusion of 13C-\nlabeled glucose into awake humans indicated th at the flux of glutamate from neurons to \nastrocytes was close to 50% of the cerebral metabolism of glucose. This would suggest a \nmassive transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes. However, if this is true, it is still \nnot known whether all this glutamate is transmi tter glutamate in the sense that it originates \nfrom presynaptic vesicles. \nIn 13C MRS studies of the brain, acetate is used as a glial substrate, and gl ucose is used as an \nenergy substrate for all brain cells, but with a dominant contribution from (glutamatergic) \nneurons. As will become evident below ('Identi fication of alternative substrates for brain \nenergy metabolism'), lactate and pyruvate have become regarded as more purely neuronal \nsubstrates that are used by glutamatergic an d GABAergic neurons alike, whereas glycerol \nappears to be a substrate specifically used by GABAergic neurons (Nguyen et al., 2003). \nThus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combi ning the \nadministration of an appropriate 13C-labeled energy substrate with 13C MRS.  \nwww.intechopen.com",

The upper spectrum is from the brain of a mouse that received [1,2-\n13C]acetate and [1-13C]glucose. The doubly labeled acetate gives rise to the double peaks in \nglutamine C4 (peak 7). The lower spectrum is from a mouse, whose astrocytic TCA ycle was \nblocked by fluoroacetate; here only glutamine labeled from [1-13C]glucose (single peak 7) \ncan be seen  (From Hassel et al., 1997, with permission from the publisher). \n4. Identification of alternative substrates for brain energ y metabolism \nSerum glucose is considered the physiological energy substrate of the brain. Even so, a \nnumber of substrates may feed into the glycolytic pathway or the TCA cycle of brain cells. \nFor example, lactate, which was shown by 13C MRS to be a substrate for brain metabolism in \nmice (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000), was recently shown by 13C MRS to contribute importantly to \nenergy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions (Gallagher et al., \n2009; Boumezbeur et al., 2010). The ability of a subs trate to function as a metabolic substrate \nfor brain cells depends on its ability to cross th e blood-brain barrier, i.e. on the presence of \nspecific transporter proteins in the barrier. Further, brain cells must have the necessary \ntransporters to take the substrates up from the extracellular fluid as well as the enzymes \nnecessary for their metabolism. A substrate that  is not metabolized in the brain after i.v. \ninjection may prove to be metabolized after intracerebral injection, a finding that points to \ntransport limitations at the blood-brain barrier ; this holds true for dicarboxylates like \nfumarate and malate (Hassel et al., 2002); if injected directly into the brain parenchyma, \nthese substrates are taken up into astrocytes and rapidly metabolized through the TCA cycle \nto glutamine, indicating the presence of th e plasma membrane dicarboxylate transporter \npredominantly in astrocytes. A similar situat ion exists for the monosaccharide fructose \n(Hassel et al., submitted), which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be \nshown by giving mice [13C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liv er, the brain does not accumulate \nthe injected [13C]fructose, as can be shown by 13C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, \nif fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of \nfructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring \nprocesses, such a axon al activity, in vitro (Meakin et al., 2007). \nEven though a substrate crosses the blood-br ain barrier, the enzymatic machinery required \nfor its metabolism may not be present in the br ain. An example is propionate, which readily \ncrosses the blood-brain barrier, but hardly beco mes metabolized in the brain (Nguyen et al., \n2007b; Morland et al., in prep). The enzyme s required for the initial metabolism of \npropionate, propionyl-CoA synthetase is expressed at low levels, making it difficult to \ndetect propionate metabolites by 13C MRS after i.v. administration of [13C]propionate to \nexperimental animals. Cerebral metabolism of propionate may be detected with \nradiolabeled propionate, however, owing to the higher sensitivity of radiodetective methods \n(scintillation counting) than of 13C MRS (Nguyen et al., 2007b). \nWith the use of 13C MRS \uf062-hydroxybutyrate (K\u00fcnnecke et al., 1993; Pan et al., 2002; Andrews \net al., 2009), lactate (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000; Tyson et al., 2003; Boumezbeur et al., 2010), \nand pyruvate (Gonzalez et al., 2005) have been shown to be energy substrates for the brain \nafter i.v. injection, pointing to the existence of the appropriate monocarboxylate transporters \nat the blood-brain barrier.

Pyruvate labeled in the 3rd carbon (which originates from glucose labeled in \nthe 1st position, [1-13C]glucose) leads to formation of malate or oxaloacetate labeled in the \n3rd carbon. This carbon position corresponds to the 2nd carbon in glutamate and \nglutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2nd than the 3rd carbon in \nglutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes \n(Shank et al., 1993; Hassel et al., 1995a; Serres  et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling \nof the 2nd over the 3rd carbon in glutamate has not been  consistently found, apparently \npointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxyl ation in neurons. Howe ver, oxaloacetate and \nmalate tend to equilibrate with the symmetri cal fumarate, leading to scrambling of label \nbetween the two carbon position. 13C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has \nbeen reported in both cultured neurons (Merle et al., 1996) and in vivo (Hassel et al., 2000; \nGonzalez et al., 2005). Another way to stud y pyruvate carboxylatio n is to use glucose \nlabeled in the 2nd position. Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13C]glucose) does not label \nacetyl-CoA, but it  may label the 2nd and 3rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through \npyruvate carboxylation. Mason et al (2007)  showed in awake human subjects the flux \nthrough pyruvate carboxylation to be approximately 6% of that through pyruvate \ndehydrogenase (the activity of which was studied with [1-13C]glucose). This value was in \ngood agreement with previous 13C MRS studies in rats (Shank et al., 1993) and with \nprevious estimates based on radiolabeling studies (Van den Berg, 1973).  \nFormation of pyruvate from TCA cycle intermed iates malate or oxaloacetate (through the \ndecarboxylating activities of malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, \nrespectively) is termed pyruvate  recycling. This process takes place in the brain (Cerdan et \nal., 1990; Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b; Cruz et al., 1998)  as it does in liver. In one study this \nprocess was identified in brain by 13C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received \n[13C]acetate, which labeled lactate (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b). Such labeling can only \noccur through formation of pyruvate from TC A cycle intermediates. When pyruvate thus \nformed (and labeled) enters the TCA cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase a distinct \nlabeling pattern may be seen in glutamate (Cerdan et al., 1990; H\u00e5berg et al., 1998). Valid \ncriticism of the interpretation of previous studies has come from Serres et al. (2008) who \npointed out that hepatic gluconeogenesis with 13C labeling of serum glucose from \n[13C]acetate may influence findings in the brain. However, pyruva te recycling also occurs in \ncultured brain cells (astrocytes), in which hepatic gluconeogenesis is not an issue \n(Sonnewald et al., 1996).  \nWith the use of 13C MRS Gruetter and colleagues were able to determine the concentration \nand turnover of glycogen in the intact brain (van Heeswijk  et al., 2010), and they also \ndescribed the formation of N-acetyl-aspartate , which is present in the brain at high \nconcentrations, from [13C]glucose, and they determined the turnover rate of this presumed \n'inert' compound (Choi et al., 2004).  \n6. The use of hyperpolarization of 13C to increase MRS sensitivity \nA problem with 13C MRS is the low sensitivity of the method. This weakness implies that \n13C-labeled metabolic substrates have to be given in large amounts to achieve detection of \ntheir metabolites. In contrast, radiolabeling studies are done with minute quantities of \nsubstrate. In an attempt to improve 13C MRS sensitivity, hyperpolarization of 13C-labeled \nwww.intechopen.com",

                "text": "13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology - Its Use in Monitoring  \nBrain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Sub strates and Metabolic Pathways \n 41 \nsubstrates has been done prior to i.v. injectio n. The MRS signal may thus be enhanced more \nthan 10,000 times (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003). In some studies pyruvate, which is \nlabeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13C]pyruvate, has been used (Hurd et al., 2010; \nMarja \u0144ska et al., 2010; Mayer et al., 2011). The [13C]pyruvate is hyperpolarized immediately \nbefore i.v. injection. The hyperpolarization is  lost within some seconds, however, and the \ndetection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see \nFig. 2). Formation of 13CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, \ni.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may ente r the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the \nbrain the activity of pyruva te dehydrogenase is quite lo w (Morland et al., 2007), and \nformation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes \n(Gonzalez et al., 2005),  so a more lik ely explanation for the formation of 13CO 2 within a few \nseconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 3): [13C]pyruvate is carboxylated  to \n[13C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13C is distributed \nevenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate. [13C]Fumarate equilibrates with \nmalate, which may become decarboxylated to pyruvate and CO 2. Some of this CO 2 will then \nbe 13C-labeled. This series of reactions has been  described in the brain with the use of [2-\n13C]pyruvate and [3-13C]pyruvate (Gonzalez et al., 2005), and they occur much more rapidly \nthan the pyruvate dehydrogenas e reaction. Another issue in st udies that use hyperpolarized \nsubstrates is the use of anesthesia , which reduces brain metabolism of 13C-labeled substrates \nmarkedly (Shank et al., 1993).  \nHyperpolarized [13C]pyruvate may prove useful in the diagnostic workup of malignant \ntumors, including brain tumors, which sh ow a greater tendency to convert [13C]pyruvate \ninto [13C]lactate than the normal surrounding tissu e. Some recent studies even suggest the \npossibility of monitoring tumor response to therapy from the reduced conversion of \npyruvate into lactate within a day\u2019s time after irradiation or chemotherapy (Day et al., 2007; \n2011; Park et al., 2011). \n7.

Applications using MR S has been found over a broad spectrum in\ninvestigating the underlying structures of compounds as well  as in determining disease states. In this book,\ntopics of MRS both relevant to the clinic and also those t hat are beyond the clinical arena are covered. The\nbook consists of two sections. The first section is entitled ' MRS inside the clinic' and is focused on clinical\napplications of MRS while the second section is entitled ' MRS beyond the clinic' and discusses applications of\nMRS in other academic fields. Our hope is that through this book, readers can understand the broad\napplications that NMR and MRS can offer and also that t here are enough references to guide the readers for\nfurther study in this important topic.\nHow to reference\nIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel f ree to copy and paste the following:\nBj\u00f8rnar Hassel (2012). 13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy i n Neurobiology - Its Use in Monitoring Brain\nEnergy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Sub strates and Metabolic Pathways, Magnetic\nResonance Spectroscopy, Prof. Dong-Hyun Kim (Ed.), ISBN: 9 78-953-51-0065-2, InTech, Available from:\nhttp://www.intechopen.com/books/magnetic-resonance-spectroscop y/13c-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy-\nin-neurobiology-its-use-in-monitoring-brain-energy-meta bolism-an\n",
