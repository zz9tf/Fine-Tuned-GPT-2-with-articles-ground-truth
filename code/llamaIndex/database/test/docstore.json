Introduction \nA wealth of information on brain metabolism has been gathered from studies in which 13C-\nlabeled metabolic substrates (often glucose) ha ve been administered to human subjects or \nexperimental animals. 13C Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS1) of the brain (or extracts \nof brain) has shown to what degree the 13C-labeled compound has been metabolized, and, to \nsome extent, along which metabolic pathways. Th e latter interpretation derives from the fact \nthat 13C MRS shows the 13C labeling not of individual compounds, e.g. amino acids, but of \nindividual carbon positions in those different  compounds (Fig. 1). Because some enzymes of \namino acid metabolism have a cell-specific expr ession, it is possible to study the metabolic \nactivity of individual cell ty pes or the transfer of amin o acids between them. Finally, 13C \nMRS allows studies of a host of substrates to examine their potential as metabolic substrates \nfor the brain. An extensive review, which incl uded an overview of technical aspects of 13C \nMRS in studies of brain and cultured brain cells , appeared recently (Rodrigues et al., 2009). \n2. 13C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism \nGlucose is considered the physiologic energy su bstrate of the brain and is used by all brain \ncells, neurons and glial cells alike.

Question: How does 13C MRS help investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism?\nAnswer: 13C MRS helps investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism because several downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, GABA, aspartate) can be detected by 13C MRS, allowing for the investigation of how neuronal activity affects energy requirements and glucose metabolism.\nReason: This question is unique because it specifically asks about how 13C MRS helps investigate the relationship between these three factors, which are important in understanding brain function and metabolism.

Neuronal activity increases energy requirements, which leads to increased glucose metabolism and the production of these downstream metabolites.\nReason: This question is unique because it specifically asks about the relationship between these three factors, which are important in understanding brain function and metabolism.
