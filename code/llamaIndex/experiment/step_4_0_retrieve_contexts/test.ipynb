       "      'original_content': 'Title: Effect of seaweed liquid extracts from Ulva lactuca on seedling growth of mung bean (Vigna radiata)\\n\\nSeaweed extracts contain a variety of compounds, such as macro-and micronutrients and plant growth regulators, which can be used by plants. Such extracts can have both negative and positive effects (depending on the concentration) when directly applied to seeds and plants. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acid seaweed liquid extracts on growth and biochemical parameters of mung bean (Vigna radiata) under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, using direct applications to seeds and seedlings. Extracts of Ulva lactuca were obtained by hydrolysis with H 2 SO 4 at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% concentrations. The effects of seaweed extracts with different concentrations, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0% were tested on germination parameters (percentage index, mean time, seedling vigour index) and growth parameters (plumule and radicle length, shoot and root length as well as fresh and dry weight) in addition to biochemical parameters (protein content, total chlorophyll, total and reduced sugar) in mung bean. The results suggest that addition of acid extracts at low concentrations (0.2%) can significantly enhance seed germination rates. Higher germination rates were associated with lower mean germination time, high germination index and, consequently, greater seedling vigour and greater plumule, radicle, shoot and root length. In addition, production (fresh and dry weight) of mung bean was significantly higher compared to the control treatments. Biochemical analysis of the seedlings treated with acid seaweed liquid extracts at 0.2% showed higher protein contents. Total chlorophyll concentration of seedlings in all treatments was significantly higher than in the controls plants, whereas the accumulation of total and reducing sugars was highest in treated plants with almost all treatments at higher concentrations.\\n\\nA number of studies are currently focused on transforming algae into high-value biomass coproducts in the form of extracts (FAO 2010). Biologically, active compounds can be extracted from algae biomass by several methods (mechanical, thermal, physical, chemical and enzymatic) using conventional solvent extraction and hydrolysis . Biologically, active compounds can be extracted from algae biomass by several methods (mechanical, thermal, physical, chemical and enzymatic) using conventional solvent extraction and hydrolysis (Michalak and Chojnacka 2014). In the production of seaweed extracts by chemical lysis, chemical agents such as acid or alkaline substances (i.e. hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide) are added to hydrolyse the biomass into constituent molecules which can then be taken up by plants . In the production of seaweed extracts by chemical lysis, chemical agents such as acid or alkaline substances (i.e. hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide) are added to hydrolyse the biomass into constituent molecules which can then be taken up by plants (Michalak et al. 2015)..\\nNew bioactive substances extracted from marine algae are used in modern agricultural and horticultural crops as biofertilisers, biostimulants or bioregulators to improve plant quality and yield and to reduce negative environmental impacts (Houssien et al. 2011). Seaweed extracts produced from algae can be beneficial for plants, e.g. by improving germination, stimulating growth and increasing concentrations of photosynthetic pigments . Seaweed extracts produced from algae can be beneficial for plants, e.g. by improving germination, stimulating growth and increasing concentrations of photosynthetic pigments (Battacharyya et al. 2015), and enhancing stress resistance , and enhancing stress resistance (Mansori et al. 2016). Polysaccharides such as ulvans from green algae (Chlorophyta) as well as oligosaccharides also can be used as biological protection agents against plant diseases ). Polysaccharides such as ulvans from green algae (Chlorophyta) as well as oligosaccharides also can be used as biological protection agents against plant diseases (Vera et al. 2011;Abkhoo and Sabbagh 2016). Seaweed polysaccharides are rich in functional groups that can bind microelement ions important in plant nutrition . Seaweed polysaccharides are rich in functional groups that can bind microelement ions important in plant nutrition (Kaplan et al. 1987)..\\nThere is a growing need to develop environmentally friendly products to improve crop productivity. In addition, it is important to develop simple in vitro methods for the preliminary screening of compounds as biostimulants that could be followed by validation in plant model. In a previous study, mung bean (Vigna radiata) was a suitable experimental model system for a number of different experiments (Tripepi and George 1991)..\\nAlgae resource use has not yet been optimised, and there is a great abundance of potentially important species such as Ulva lactuca. In Mexico, but also in other countries, the suitability of U. lactuca as biofertiliser or biostimulant has not yet been investigated adequately and there are no studies on the effects of sulfuric acid on U. lactuca to produce seaweed extract. However, the addition of various concentrations of H 2 SO 4 would be helpful to understand the properties of seaweed extracts and their effect on plant growth. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effects of acid seaweed extracts on growth and biochemical parameters of mung bean.\\n\\nUlva lactuca (Linnaeus) was collected in La Paz, Baja California Sur, México (24°12′ 5.05″ Na n d1 1 0 °1 8 ′ 0.47″ W), in September 2014. The seaweed was washed with tap water to remove epiphytes, salts and particles and subsequently dried, milled to 0.50 mm particle size and stored at room temperature.\\n\\nExtracts of U. lactuca were prepared according to the thermochemical method (Jang et al. 2012). Seaweed powder was treated with 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% (v/v)H 2 SO 4 and autoclaved at 12.4 kPa and 121°°C for 30 min. The liquid obtained from the hydrolysed biomass was filtered through Whatman no. 40 filter paper. The pH of the acid seaweed liquid extracts (ASLEs) was adjusted to 4 with potassium hydroxide and stored at room temperature prior to analysis. The extracts obtained served as stock solutions according to the percentage of acid used: UL2, UL4, UL6, UL8 and UL10.

Wilczek seeds with uniform size, colour and weight were selected.\\n\\nMoisture content of seeds Three samples of 100 seeds were used to determine moisture content. Dry seed weight was obtained by oven-drying at 130°C for 1 h (ISTA 1999)an d subsequent weighing on an analytical balance. Moisture content (MC) was calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nFresh weight-Dry weight Dry weight Â 100:\\nSeed imbibition The initial weight of three batches of 100 seeds was established without embedding. Each batch was placed in a beaker with 25 mL of each acid seaweed liquid extracts (ASLEs) and distilled water in the control (at 24°C).\\nSeed weight was determined at the beginning of the experiment and after every hour during the first 6 h, then after 12, 24 and 48 h, using an analytical balance. The experiments were performed in triplicate (n = 100 seeds for each treatment). To determine the appropriate time for seed imbibition, we plotted the water imbibition curve (Larreta et al. 2008). .\\n\\nMung bean seeds with uniform size and colour were soaked for 6 h in different concentrations of acid seaweed extracts and in water (control). Subsequently, the seeds were rinsed in sterilised distilled water and sown in a chamber containing sterilised soil peat moss (Sunshine Mix 3). Plants were grown in the greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C and 85% relative humidity. After 15 days of the germination, 20 plants were selected and morphological characteristics such as shoot length, root length and fresh weight were measured. The experimental units were arranged in a completely randomised bifactorial design. A total of 26 different treatments were tested, using ten replications. In the control, seeds were soaked with distilled water. Two factors were randomised for the other 25 ASLEs treatments: quantity of sulfuric acid (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10%) used to hydrolyse seaweed extracts and concentration (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%) used to soak the seeds.\\n\\nThere were significant differences in the biochemical status of different treatments and concentration levels. All treatments at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in protein, with concentration levels higher of 4.58% compared to the control (Fig. 4). Protein content increased in seedlings treated with low concentrations (UL2 and UL4) and declined in treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL6, UL8 and UL10).). Protein content increased in seedlings treated with low concentrations (UL2 and UL4) and declined in treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL6, UL8 and UL10).\\nOptimal results in terms of protein content were achieved with treatment UL2. Photosynthetic pigments in mung bean leaves were enhanced by all treatments compared to the control (Fig. 5). The concentration of total chlorophyll in leaves was higher in treatments UL2 and UL4 at 1.0% (557.3 and 577.4 μg g -1 fresh weight, FW, respectively) and UL6 at 0.4% (687.4 μgg -1 FW) as well as in UL8 and UL10 at 0.2% (625.6 and 570 μgg -1 FW, respectively) compared to the control (Fig. ). The concentration of total chlorophyll in leaves was higher in treatments UL2 and UL4 at 1.0% (557.3 and 577.4 μg g -1 fresh weight, FW, respectively) and UL6 at 0.4% (687.4 μgg -1 FW) as well as in UL8 and UL10 at 0.2% (625.6 and 570 μgg -1 FW, respectively) compared to the control (Fig. 5).).\\nTotal sugar (TS) and reduced sugar (RS) content values of shoots are presented in Table 3. In the case of total carbohydrates and total reduced sugars, maximum contents were found (P ≤ 0.05) in mung beans of treatments UL2, UL4 and UL8 at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%). In contrast, in plants treated with UL6 and UL10 at 0.4%, TS content was positively significantly affected (P ≤ 0.05). Treatments had no significant effect on RS concentrations. .

For comparison of means of multiple groups or treatments, analysis of variance (one-and two-way ANOVA) and multiple comparison test of least significant difference (LSD) (α = 0.05) were used. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package Statgraphics Centurion XV for Windows.\\n\\nCarbohydrates, minerals and proteins were the most abundant chemical components of green seaweed. In contrast, fibre and lipid contents were low; moisture content was relatively low. Sodium concentration was high, followed by nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus (Table 1). Higher amounts of carbohydrates were released from dried Ulva biomass after thermochemical hydrolysis with 2% H 2 SO 4 and autoclaving at 12.4 kPa and 121°C for 30 min (Table ). Higher amounts of carbohydrates were released from dried Ulva biomass after thermochemical hydrolysis with 2% H 2 SO 4 and autoclaving at 12.4 kPa and 121°C for 30 min (Table 1).).\\n\\nMoisture content and imbibition of the mung bean seeds Average moisture content of the mung bean seed was 6.3% (ww). Seeds began to take up water immediately after soaking. The progress of seed imbibition was generally followed by an increase in weight. During the early stages of soaking (about 3 h), the average percentage of water absorbed was less than 60% in all treatments. For seeds in most of the treatments at low concentration (0.2%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was less than 80%. In contrast, in seeds soaked in extracts at high concentrations (0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was 100%. Water imbibition curve plotted showed that the minimum time needed to reach the maximum water imbibition was 6 h (Fig. 1).).\\nGermination percentage and growth of mung bean seedlings Seed coat rupture and germination occurred in all treatments after 2 days. The seedlings elongated rapidly during the first week. The ASLEs had a significant positive effect (P ≤ 0.05) on seed germination; especially in treatments at low concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%) (Table 2).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table ).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table 2). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table ). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table 2).).\\nThe treatments UL2, UL4 and UL6 at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in plumule length (10.4, 9.7 and 10 cm), radicle length (7.6, 7.3 and 8.0 cm) and dry weight (0.23 g) compared to the control (Fig. 2a-c). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.\\n\\nSoaking seeds for 6 h significantly positively affected seedling growth (P ≤ 0.05).

However, significant growth reductions were obtained with higher concentrations of seaweed extracts in UL10. ). However, significant growth reductions were obtained with higher concentrations of seaweed extracts in UL10.\\n\\nUlva lactuca is commonly used as a biofertiliser due to its high levels of nitrogen, nutrients, growth hormones and other important physiochemical compounds (Divya et al. 2015). In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.. In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.\\nWater is imbibed into the seed due to the difference in water potential between the seed and its environment. The rate of imbibition can be influenced by characteristics such as percentage of solids (carbohydrates, minerals and protein) present in the extracts as a result of the level of hydrolysis during the production of the algae extracts. The amount of total sugar released during hydrolysis of Ulva under controlled parameters suggests that the percentage of acid is the most important variable in monosaccharide release (Jiang et al. 2016)..\\nIn this research, the average percentage of absorbed water was low in treatments with hydrolysed seaweed extracts UL2 and low sulfuric acid concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%). In contrast, treatments with higher concentrations of sulfuric acid resulted in high average water absorption (100%). Increasing t h ep e r c e n t a g eo fs u l f u r i ca c i dt o2 %l e v e l ,l e dt oah i g h e r percentage of solids (15%) (rhamnose, glucose and xylose); however, further increase in acid concentration did not increase in monosaccharide yield (Jiang et al. 2016)..\\nSeeds treated with low concentrations (0.2%) and growing under laboratory conditions showed increased germination. However, seeds treated with most treatments at high concentrations (1.0%) showed reduced germination. This finding can be explained by the high amounts of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins in the extracts hydrolysed with low concentrations of sulfuric acid. It is possible that some of the acid treatments may have affected the osmotic potential, thus preventing the development of turgor pressure in the seed, which is considered as one of the key factors for the initiation of radicle growth during seed germination (Maia and Rainer 2001). The results show that an increase in the hydrolysis of seaweed with sulfuric acid as well as increased concentrations of seaweed extract reduced seedling growth. This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by .

This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by Haug and Larsen (1962) that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants. that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants.\\nWe found statistically significant differences in shoot length, root length and fresh weight of plants from seeds imbibed in acid seaweed extracts. A positive differential response was observed for the treatments UL2 at 0.2%, UL4 at 0.8%, UL6 at 1.0%, UL8 at 0.8 and UL 10 at 0.6%. The increased seedling growth may be due to the presence of growth-promoting substances (Crouch and van Staden 1992). Growth hormones play an imperative role in increase of cell size and cell division and complement each other; e.g. cytokinin is effective in shoot formation and auxin in root development. Other closely related compounds such as polysaccharides (ulvans or their derived oligosaccharides) can also act as plant growth promoters .

However, higher concentrations (0.6 to 1.0%) generally decreased growth parameters.\\nIn the present study, applying ASLEs obtained from the green seaweed U. lactuca to Vigna radiata resulted in interesting findings. Biochemical analysis showed that plants from seeds treated with high concentrations of ASLEs exhibited more photosynthetic pigments as well as total and reducing sugars. Increased protein contents at lower concentrations of ASLEs might be due to absorption of most of the necessary elements by the seedlings (Kannan et al. 1990;Anantharaj and Venkatesalu 2001;Sivasankari et al. 2006). In the present study, concentrations of total and reducing sugar were increased with the addition of high concentrations of U. lactuca extract. In a similar study, addition of 1% U. lactuca extract along with 50% the recommended rate of chemical fertilisers enhanced protein and carbohydrate concentrations in Tagetus erecta ).

In a similar study, addition of 1% U. lactuca extract along with 50% the recommended rate of chemical fertilisers enhanced protein and carbohydrate concentrations in Tagetus erecta (Sridhar and Rengasamy 2010).

These findings coincide with some earlier reports that seaweed extracts enhanced the biochemical constituents in crops . These findings coincide with some earlier reports that seaweed extracts enhanced the biochemical constituents in crops (Gireesh et al. 2011;Kalaivanan and Venkatesalu 2012).

Also, treatment with ASLEs in all concentrations enhanced chlorophyll concentrations. The results confirm that imbibed seeds show increased germination rates, seedling growth and protein content; these findings are similar to those observed by Ibrahim et al. (2014)..\\nIn conclusion, the results indicate that acid seaweed liquid extracts obtained with (UL2 at 0.2% and UL4 at 0.8%) significantly, impact the growth of mung bean plants. The different concentrations of ASLEs varied in their effects on biochemical growth parameters. Treatments produced with minim levels of sulfuric acid (UL2 and UL4) and applied at low concentrations showed better effects on growth parameters and protein contents. Moreover, treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL8 and UL10) decreased plant growth under laboratory conditions. In contrast, all treatments containing ASLEs, except at high concentrations, displayed a significant effect on root length, associated with an increase of chlorophyll and sugars.\\nWe recommend the use of hydrolysed algal biomass with low concentrations of sulfuric acid to produce ASLEs. The UL Ulva lactuca applied dose will depend on the specific crop. Low concentrations of algal extracts are recommended to increase foliage and high concentrations to obtain higher root lengths and increase biochemical plant parameters. However, further greenhouse and field experiments are needed to evaluate the effects of algal extracts on plant growth.\\n\\n',\n",

Such extracts can have both negative and positive effects (depending on the concentration) when directly applied to seeds and plants. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acid seaweed liquid extracts on growth and biochemical parameters of mung bean (Vigna radiata) under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, using direct applications to seeds and seedlings. Extracts of Ulva lactuca were obtained by hydrolysis with H 2 SO 4 at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% concentrations. The effects of seaweed extracts with different concentrations, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0% were tested on germination parameters (percentage index, mean time, seedling vigour index) and growth parameters (plumule and radicle length, shoot and root length as well as fresh and dry weight) in addition to biochemical parameters (protein content, total chlorophyll, total and reduced sugar) in mung bean. The results suggest that addition of acid extracts at low concentrations (0.2%) can significantly enhance seed germination rates. Higher germination rates were associated with lower mean germination time, high germination index and, consequently, greater seedling vigour and greater plumule, radicle, shoot and root length. In addition, production (fresh and dry weight) of mung bean was significantly higher compared to the control treatments. Biochemical analysis of the seedlings treated with acid seaweed liquid extracts at 0.2% showed higher protein contents. Total chlorophyll concentration of seedlings in all treatments was significantly higher than in the controls plants, whereas the accumulation of total and reducing sugars was highest in treated plants with almost all treatments at higher concentrations.\\n\\nA number of studies are currently focused on transforming algae into high-value biomass coproducts in the form of extracts (FAO 2010). Biologically, active compounds can be extracted from algae biomass by several methods (mechanical, thermal, physical, chemical and enzymatic) using conventional solvent extraction and hydrolysis . Biologically, active compounds can be extracted from algae biomass by several methods (mechanical, thermal, physical, chemical and enzymatic) using conventional solvent extraction and hydrolysis (Michalak and Chojnacka 2014). In the production of seaweed extracts by chemical lysis, chemical agents such as acid or alkaline substances (i.e. hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide) are added to hydrolyse the biomass into constituent molecules which can then be taken up by plants . In the production of seaweed extracts by chemical lysis, chemical agents such as acid or alkaline substances (i.e. hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide) are added to hydrolyse the biomass into constituent molecules which can then be taken up by plants (Michalak et al. 2015)..\\nNew bioactive substances extracted from marine algae are used in modern agricultural and horticultural crops as biofertilisers, biostimulants or bioregulators to improve plant quality and yield and to reduce negative environmental impacts (Houssien et al. 2011). Seaweed extracts produced from algae can be beneficial for plants, e.g. by improving germination, stimulating growth and increasing concentrations of photosynthetic pigments .

Seaweed polysaccharides are rich in functional groups that can bind microelement ions important in plant nutrition (Kaplan et al. 1987)..\\nThere is a growing need to develop environmentally friendly products to improve crop productivity. In addition, it is important to develop simple in vitro methods for the preliminary screening of compounds as biostimulants that could be followed by validation in plant model. In a previous study, mung bean (Vigna radiata) was a suitable experimental model system for a number of different experiments (Tripepi and George 1991)..\\nAlgae resource use has not yet been optimised, and there is a great abundance of potentially important species such as Ulva lactuca. In Mexico, but also in other countries, the suitability of U. lactuca as biofertiliser or biostimulant has not yet been investigated adequately and there are no studies on the effects of sulfuric acid on U. lactuca to produce seaweed extract. However, the addition of various concentrations of H 2 SO 4 would be helpful to understand the properties of seaweed extracts and their effect on plant growth. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effects of acid seaweed extracts on growth and biochemical parameters of mung bean.\\n\\nUlva lactuca (Linnaeus) was collected in La Paz, Baja California Sur, México (24°12′ 5.05″ Na n d1 1 0 °1 8 ′ 0.47″ W), in September 2014. The seaweed was washed with tap water to remove epiphytes, salts and particles and subsequently dried, milled to 0.50 mm particle size and stored at room temperature.\\n\\nExtracts of U. lactuca were prepared according to the thermochemical method (Jang et al. 2012). Seaweed powder was treated with 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% (v/v)H 2 SO 4 and autoclaved at 12.4 kPa and 121°°C for 30 min. The liquid obtained from the hydrolysed biomass was filtered through Whatman no. 40 filter paper. The pH of the acid seaweed liquid extracts (ASLEs) was adjusted to 4 with potassium hydroxide and stored at room temperature prior to analysis. The extracts obtained served as stock solutions according to the percentage of acid used: UL2, UL4, UL6, UL8 and UL10. Finally, the acid extracts were neutralised to pH 7 with Ca 2 CO 3 and diluted to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0% for further applications to the seeds and seedlings..

The moisture content (drying at 60°C until constant weight, method 976.05), dry matter was determined gravimetrically as the residue remaining after drying, ash (calcination at 550°C via muffle method 930.36), crude fibre (method 962.09), ether extract (Soxhlet apparatus, method 954.04) and nitrogen content by micro-Kjeldahl (method 976.05). To calculate the protein content, the conversion factor of 6.25 (method 954.04) was used. Indirect estimation of carbohydrates was calculated according to the following equation: percent carbohydrates = 100-(% protein + % ether extract); Mineral composition and carbohydrate data were obtained from .

(2014)a n d a n d Jiang et al. (2016), who used thermochemical hydrolysis., who used thermochemical hydrolysis.\\n\\nVigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek seeds with uniform size, colour and weight were selected.\\n\\nMoisture content of seeds Three samples of 100 seeds were used to determine moisture content. Dry seed weight was obtained by oven-drying at 130°C for 1 h (ISTA 1999)an d subsequent weighing on an analytical balance. Moisture content (MC) was calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nFresh weight-Dry weight Dry weight Â 100:\\nSeed imbibition The initial weight of three batches of 100 seeds was established without embedding. Each batch was placed in a beaker with 25 mL of each acid seaweed liquid extracts (ASLEs) and distilled water in the control (at 24°C).\\nSeed weight was determined at the beginning of the experiment and after every hour during the first 6 h, then after 12, 24 and 48 h, using an analytical balance. The experiments were performed in triplicate (n = 100 seeds for each treatment). To determine the appropriate time for seed imbibition, we plotted the water imbibition curve (Larreta et al. 2008). .\\n\\nMung bean seeds with uniform size and colour were soaked for 6 h in different concentrations of acid seaweed extracts and in water (control). Subsequently, the seeds were rinsed in sterilised distilled water and sown in a chamber containing sterilised soil peat moss (Sunshine Mix 3). Plants were grown in the greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C and 85% relative humidity. After 15 days of the germination, 20 plants were selected and morphological characteristics such as shoot length, root length and fresh weight were measured. The experimental units were arranged in a completely randomised bifactorial design. A total of 26 different treatments were tested, using ten replications. In the control, seeds were soaked with distilled water. Two factors were randomised for the other 25 ASLEs treatments: quantity of sulfuric acid (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10%) used to hydrolyse seaweed extracts and concentration (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%) used to soak the seeds.\\n\\nThere were significant differences in the biochemical status of different treatments and concentration levels. All treatments at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in protein, with concentration levels higher of 4.58% compared to the control (Fig. 4). Protein content increased in seedlings treated with low concentrations (UL2 and UL4) and declined in treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL6, UL8 and UL10).). Protein content increased in seedlings treated with low concentrations (UL2 and UL4) and declined in treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL6, UL8 and UL10).\\nOptimal results in terms of protein content were achieved with treatment UL2. Photosynthetic pigments in mung bean leaves were enhanced by all treatments compared to the control (Fig. 5). The concentration of total chlorophyll in leaves was higher in treatments UL2 and UL4 at 1.0% (557.3 and 577.4 μg g -1 fresh weight, FW, respectively) and UL6 at 0.4% (687.4 μgg -1 FW) as well as in UL8 and UL10 at 0.2% (625.6 and 570 μgg -1 FW, respectively) compared to the control (Fig. ). The concentration of total chlorophyll in leaves was higher in treatments UL2 and UL4 at 1.0% (557.3 and 577.4 μg g -1 fresh weight, FW, respectively) and UL6 at 0.4% (687.4 μgg -1 FW) as well as in UL8 and UL10 at 0.2% (625.6 and 570 μgg -1 FW, respectively) compared to the control (Fig. 5).).\\nTotal sugar (TS) and reduced sugar (RS) content values of shoots are presented in Table 3. In the case of total carbohydrates and total reduced sugars, maximum contents were found (P ≤ 0.05) in mung beans of treatments UL2, UL4 and UL8 at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%). In contrast, in plants treated with UL6 and UL10 at 0.4%, TS content was positively significantly affected (P ≤ 0.05). Treatments had no significant effect on RS concentrations. . In the case of total carbohydrates and total reduced sugars, maximum contents were found (P ≤ 0.05) in mung beans of treatments UL2, UL4 and UL8 at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%). In contrast, in plants treated with UL6 and UL10 at 0.4%, TS content was positively significantly affected (P ≤ 0.05). Treatments had no significant effect on RS concentrations.\\n\\nAll data were tested for normality and homoscedasticity. For comparison of means of multiple groups or treatments, analysis of variance (one-and two-way ANOVA) and multiple comparison test of least significant difference (LSD) (α = 0.05) were used. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package Statgraphics Centurion XV for Windows.\\n\\nCarbohydrates, minerals and proteins were the most abundant chemical components of green seaweed. In contrast, fibre and lipid contents were low; moisture content was relatively low. Sodium concentration was high, followed by nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus (Table 1). Higher amounts of carbohydrates were released from dried Ulva biomass after thermochemical hydrolysis with 2% H 2 SO 4 and autoclaving at 12.4 kPa and 121°C for 30 min (Table ). Higher amounts of carbohydrates were released from dried Ulva biomass after thermochemical hydrolysis with 2% H 2 SO 4 and autoclaving at 12.4 kPa and 121°C for 30 min (Table 1).).\\n\\nMoisture content and imbibition of the mung bean seeds Average moisture content of the mung bean seed was 6.3% (ww). Seeds began to take up water immediately after soaking. The progress of seed imbibition was generally followed by an increase in weight. During the early stages of soaking (about 3 h), the average percentage of water absorbed was less than 60% in all treatments. For seeds in most of the treatments at low concentration (0.2%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was less than 80%. In contrast, in seeds soaked in extracts at high concentrations (0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was 100%. Water imbibition curve plotted showed that the minimum time needed to reach the maximum water imbibition was 6 h (Fig. 1).).\\nGermination percentage and growth of mung bean seedlings Seed coat rupture and germination occurred in all treatments after 2 days. The seedlings elongated rapidly during the first week. The ASLEs had a significant positive effect (P ≤ 0.05) on seed germination; especially in treatments at low concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%) (Table 2).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table ).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table 2). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table ). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table 2).).\\nThe treatments UL2, UL4 and UL6 at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in plumule length (10.4, 9.7 and 10 cm), radicle length (7.6, 7.3 and 8.0 cm) and dry weight (0.23 g) compared to the control (Fig. 2a-c). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.\\n\\nSoaking seeds for 6 h significantly positively affected seedling growth (P ≤ 0.05). Seeds treated with acid seaweed liquid extracts in growth parameters compared to the control (Fig. 3a-c).).\\nTreating seeds with high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) of acid seaweed liquid extracts showed significantly positive (P ≤ 0.05) effects on root length (12.3 to 15.08 cm) compared to the control (9.24 cm) (Fig. 3b). In contrast, treating seeds with seaweed extract in UL2 at 0.2% resulted in significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher shoot length (16.10 cm) and fresh weight (1.04 g) compared to the control treatment (Fig. ). In contrast, treating seeds with seaweed extract in UL2 at 0.2% resulted in significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher shoot length (16.10 cm) and fresh weight (1.04 g) compared to the control treatment (Fig. 3a,c). However, significant growth reductions were obtained with higher concentrations of seaweed extracts in UL10. ). However, significant growth reductions were obtained with higher concentrations of seaweed extracts in UL10.\\n\\nUlva lactuca is commonly used as a biofertiliser due to its high levels of nitrogen, nutrients, growth hormones and other important physiochemical compounds (Divya et al. 2015). In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.. In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.\\nWater is imbibed into the seed due to the difference in water potential between the seed and its environment. The rate of imbibition can be influenced by characteristics such as percentage of solids (carbohydrates, minerals and protein) present in the extracts as a result of the level of hydrolysis during the production of the algae extracts. The amount of total sugar released during hydrolysis of Ulva under controlled parameters suggests that the percentage of acid is the most important variable in monosaccharide release (Jiang et al. 2016)..\\nIn this research, the average percentage of absorbed water was low in treatments with hydrolysed seaweed extracts UL2 and low sulfuric acid concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%). In contrast, treatments with higher concentrations of sulfuric acid resulted in high average water absorption (100%). Increasing t h ep e r c e n t a g eo fs u l f u r i ca c i dt o2 %l e v e l ,l e dt oah i g h e r percentage of solids (15%) (rhamnose, glucose and xylose); however, further increase in acid concentration did not increase in monosaccharide yield (Jiang et al. 2016)..\\nSeeds treated with low concentrations (0.2%) and growing under laboratory conditions showed increased germination. However, seeds treated with most treatments at high concentrations (1.0%) showed reduced germination. This finding can be explained by the high amounts of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins in the extracts hydrolysed with low concentrations of sulfuric acid. It is possible that some of the acid treatments may have affected the osmotic potential, thus preventing the development of turgor pressure in the seed, which is considered as one of the key factors for the initiation of radicle growth during seed germination (Maia and Rainer 2001). The results show that an increase in the hydrolysis of seaweed with sulfuric acid as well as increased concentrations of seaweed extract reduced seedling growth. This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by . The results show that an increase in the hydrolysis of seaweed with sulfuric acid as well as increased concentrations of seaweed extract reduced seedling growth. This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by Haug and Larsen (1962) that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants. that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants.\\nWe found statistically significant differences in shoot length, root length and fresh weight of plants from seeds imbibed in acid seaweed extracts. A positive differential response was observed for the treatments UL2 at 0.2%, UL4 at 0.8%, UL6 at 1.0%, UL8 at 0.8 and UL 10 at 0.6%. The increased seedling growth may be due to the presence of growth-promoting substances (Crouch and van Staden 1992). Growth hormones play an imperative role in increase of cell size and cell division and complement each other; e.g. cytokinin is effective in shoot formation and auxin in root development. Other closely related compounds such as polysaccharides (ulvans or their derived oligosaccharides) can also act as plant growth promoters .

However, higher concentrations (0.6 to 1.0%) generally decreased growth parameters.\\nIn the present study, applying ASLEs obtained from the green seaweed U. lactuca to Vigna radiata resulted in interesting findings. Biochemical analysis showed that plants from seeds treated with high concentrations of ASLEs exhibited more photosynthetic pigments as well as total and reducing sugars. Increased protein contents at lower concentrations of ASLEs might be due to absorption of most of the necessary elements by the seedlings (Kannan et al. 1990;Anantharaj and Venkatesalu 2001;Sivasankari et al. 2006). In the present study, concentrations of total and reducing sugar were increased with the addition of high concentrations of U. lactuca extract. In a similar study, addition of 1% U. lactuca extract along with 50% the recommended rate of chemical fertilisers enhanced protein and carbohydrate concentrations in Tagetus erecta ). In the present study, concentrations of total and reducing sugar were increased with the addition of high concentrations of U. lactuca extract. In a similar study, addition of 1% U. lactuca extract along with 50% the recommended rate of chemical fertilisers enhanced protein and carbohydrate concentrations in Tagetus erecta (Sridhar and Rengasamy 2010). The increase in total sugars and reducing sugar may be due to the presence of magnesium, which could have triggered chlorophyll synthesis and thereby, subsequently increased photosynthetic rates .

In plants with longer roots, maximum TS and RS accumulation levels were found.. In plants with longer roots, maximum TS and RS accumulation levels were found.\\nSeaweed extracts contain significant amounts of cytokinins, auxins and betaines, which enhance chlorophyll concentration in the leaves (Blunden et al. 1997;Sc hw aban dR aa b 2004), increase in number and size of the chloroplasts and improve grana development ;Sc hw aban dR aa b 2004), increase in number and size of the chloroplasts and improve grana development (Atzmon and Van Staden 1994). These findings coincide with some earlier reports that seaweed extracts enhanced the biochemical constituents in crops . These findings coincide with some earlier reports that seaweed extracts enhanced the biochemical constituents in crops (Gireesh et al. 2011;Kalaivanan and Venkatesalu 2012). Also, treatment with ASLEs in all concentrations enhanced chlorophyll concentrations. The results confirm that imbibed seeds show increased germination rates, seedling growth and protein content; these findings are similar to those observed by . Also, treatment with ASLEs in all concentrations enhanced chlorophyll concentrations. The results confirm that imbibed seeds show increased germination rates, seedling growth and protein content; these findings are similar to those observed by Ibrahim et al. (2014)..\\nIn conclusion, the results indicate that acid seaweed liquid extracts obtained with (UL2 at 0.2% and UL4 at 0.8%) significantly, impact the growth of mung bean plants. The different concentrations of ASLEs varied in their effects on biochemical growth parameters. Treatments produced with minim levels of sulfuric acid (UL2 and UL4) and applied at low concentrations showed better effects on growth parameters and protein contents. Moreover, treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL8 and UL10) decreased plant growth under laboratory conditions. In contrast, all treatments containing ASLEs, except at high concentrations, displayed a significant effect on root length, associated with an increase of chlorophyll and sugars.\\nWe recommend the use of hydrolysed algal biomass with low concentrations of sulfuric acid to produce ASLEs. The UL Ulva lactuca applied dose will depend on the specific crop. Low concentrations of algal extracts are recommended to increase foliage and high concentrations to obtain higher root lengths and increase biochemical plant parameters. However, further greenhouse and field experiments are needed to evaluate the effects of algal extracts on plant growth.\\n\\n',\n",

       "      'original_content': 'Moisture content and imbibition of the mung bean seeds Average moisture content of the mung bean seed was 6.3% (ww). Seeds began to take up water immediately after soaking. The progress of seed imbibition was generally followed by an increase in weight. During the early stages of soaking (about 3 h), the average percentage of water absorbed was less than 60% in all treatments. For seeds in most of the treatments at low concentration (0.2%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was less than 80%. In contrast, in seeds soaked in extracts at high concentrations (0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was 100%. Water imbibition curve plotted showed that the minimum time needed to reach the maximum water imbibition was 6 h (Fig. 1).).\\nGermination percentage and growth of mung bean seedlings Seed coat rupture and germination occurred in all treatments after 2 days. The seedlings elongated rapidly during the first week. The ASLEs had a significant positive effect (P ≤ 0.05) on seed germination; especially in treatments at low concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%) (Table 2).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table ).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table 2). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table ). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table 2).).\\nThe treatments UL2, UL4 and UL6 at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in plumule length (10.4, 9.7 and 10 cm), radicle length (7.6, 7.3 and 8.0 cm) and dry weight (0.23 g) compared to the control (Fig. 2a-c). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.',\n",

Seeds began to take up water immediately after soaking. The progress of seed imbibition was generally followed by an increase in weight. During the early stages of soaking (about 3 h), the average percentage of water absorbed was less than 60% in all treatments. For seeds in most of the treatments at low concentration (0.2%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was less than 80%. In contrast, in seeds soaked in extracts at high concentrations (0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%), the average percentage of water absorbed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was 100%. Water imbibition curve plotted showed that the minimum time needed to reach the maximum water imbibition was 6 h (Fig. 1).).\\nGermination percentage and growth of mung bean seedlings Seed coat rupture and germination occurred in all treatments after 2 days. The seedlings elongated rapidly during the first week. The ASLEs had a significant positive effect (P ≤ 0.05) on seed germination; especially in treatments at low concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%) (Table 2).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table ).  Seeds treated with ASLE of U. lactuca at 0.2% showed significantly higher germination rates, associated with lower MGT and higher seedling vigour (Table 2). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table ). Seeds treated with ASLEs at 0.2% showed high GP values (97 to 100%), elevated GI values (25 to 27), a reduction in MGT (4.5 days), and enhanced SVI levels (1543 to 1800). In contrast, treatments at high concentrations of 1.0% delayed germination parameters of mung bean seeds over time (Table 2).).\\nThe treatments UL2, UL4 and UL6 at a concentration of 0.2% resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in plumule length (10.4, 9.7 and 10 cm), radicle length (7.6, 7.3 and 8.0 cm) and dry weight (0.23 g) compared to the control (Fig. 2a-c). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.). In contrast, most treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) decreased plumule, radicle length and dry weight.',\n",

       "      'original_content': 'Ulva lactuca is commonly used as a biofertiliser due to its high levels of nitrogen, nutrients, growth hormones and other important physiochemical compounds (Divya et al. 2015). In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.. In this study, higher concentrations of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins were achieved with acid extract treatments. Seaweed extract from U. lactuca positively influenced seed imbibition, germination and seedling growth as well as biochemical parameters of mung bean plants.\\nWater is imbibed into the seed due to the difference in water potential between the seed and its environment. The rate of imbibition can be influenced by characteristics such as percentage of solids (carbohydrates, minerals and protein) present in the extracts as a result of the level of hydrolysis during the production of the algae extracts. The amount of total sugar released during hydrolysis of Ulva under controlled parameters suggests that the percentage of acid is the most important variable in monosaccharide release (Jiang et al. 2016)..\\nIn this research, the average percentage of absorbed water was low in treatments with hydrolysed seaweed extracts UL2 and low sulfuric acid concentrations (0.2 and 0.4%). In contrast, treatments with higher concentrations of sulfuric acid resulted in high average water absorption (100%).

However, seeds treated with most treatments at high concentrations (1.0%) showed reduced germination. This finding can be explained by the high amounts of carbohydrates, minerals and proteins in the extracts hydrolysed with low concentrations of sulfuric acid. It is possible that some of the acid treatments may have affected the osmotic potential, thus preventing the development of turgor pressure in the seed, which is considered as one of the key factors for the initiation of radicle growth during seed germination (Maia and Rainer 2001). The results show that an increase in the hydrolysis of seaweed with sulfuric acid as well as increased concentrations of seaweed extract reduced seedling growth. This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by . The results show that an increase in the hydrolysis of seaweed with sulfuric acid as well as increased concentrations of seaweed extract reduced seedling growth. This indicates a considerable decrease in hydrolysis in treatments with high sulfuric acid concentrations (UL8 and UL10), while treatments at high concentrations (0.8 and 1.0%) inhibit plant growth. This finding is in agreement with the results observed by Haug and Larsen (1962) that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants. that suggest that hydrolysis with strong acid treatment should have an effect on hydrolysates products that may not possibly assimilated by the plants.\\nWe found statistically significant differences in shoot length, root length and fresh weight of plants from seeds imbibed in acid seaweed extracts. A positive differential response was observed for the treatments UL2 at 0.2%, UL4 at 0.8%, UL6 at 1.0%, UL8 at 0.8 and UL 10 at 0.6%.\\nThe increased seedling growth may be due to the presence of growth-promoting substances (Crouch and van Staden 1992). Growth hormones play an imperative role in increase of cell size and cell division and complement each other; e.g. cytokinin is effective in shoot formation and auxin in root development. Other closely related compounds such as polysaccharides (ulvans or their derived oligosaccharides) can also act as plant growth promoters .

However, higher concentrations (0.6 to 1.0%) generally decreased growth parameters.\\nIn the present study, applying ASLEs obtained from the green seaweed U. lactuca to Vigna radiata resulted in interesting findings. Biochemical analysis showed that plants from seeds treated with high concentrations of ASLEs exhibited more photosynthetic pigments as well as total and reducing sugars. Increased protein contents at lower concentrations of ASLEs might be due to absorption of most of the necessary elements by the seedlings (Kannan et al. 1990;Anantharaj and Venkatesalu 2001;Sivasankari et al. 2006). In the present study, concentrations of total and reducing sugar were increased with the addition of high concentrations of U. lactuca extract. In a similar study, addition of 1% U. lactuca extract along with 50% the recommended rate of chemical fertilisers enhanced protein and carbohydrate concentrations in Tagetus erecta ).\\nIn the present study, concentrations of total and reducing sugar were increased with the addition of high concentrations of U. lactuca extract.

Also, treatment with ASLEs in all concentrations enhanced chlorophyll concentrations. The results confirm that imbibed seeds show increased germination rates, seedling growth and protein content; these findings are similar to those observed by Ibrahim et al.

The different concentrations of ASLEs varied in their effects on biochemical growth parameters. Treatments produced with minim levels of sulfuric acid (UL2 and UL4) and applied at low concentrations showed better effects on growth parameters and protein contents. Moreover, treatments with high levels of sulfuric acid (UL8 and UL10) decreased plant growth under laboratory conditions. In contrast, all treatments containing ASLEs, except at high concentrations, displayed a significant effect on root length, associated with an increase of chlorophyll and sugars.\\nWe recommend the use of hydrolysed algal biomass with low concentrations of sulfuric acid to produce ASLEs. The UL Ulva lactuca applied dose will depend on the specific crop. Low concentrations of algal extracts are recommended to increase foliage and high concentrations to obtain higher root lengths and increase biochemical plant parameters.

The amount of total sugar released during hydrolysis of Ulva under controlled parameters suggests that the percentage of acid is the most important variable in monosaccharide release (Jiang et al. 2016)..',\n",

Improved plant mineral nutrition through the fungal part ner was first described a long time ago; in return, the plant delivers carbon substrates to the fungal partner. The first transport sys tems involved in plant-microorganism inter actions in plants and fungi were also identified years ago.\\nWithin this chapter, recent knowledge concerning mycorrhizal nutrient exchanges and the involved molecular players in membrane transport of the ecto-and endo mycorrhizal partners will be presented. First, transport of sugars from plants towards mycorrhizal fungi is summarized. Then, uptake and exchange of main nutri ents such as nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, potassium, and water by the symbiotic partners will be reviewed.\\n\\nIn the mycorrhizal associations, in return for mineral nutrient provisioning, the plant provides sugar photosynthates to the heter otrophic symbiont. This trade is regulated by both plant and fungal transport components, as for instance the long-distance transport of sucrose from leaves towards mycorrhizal roots and subsequent cellular transfer of monosaccharides at the symbiotic interface (Doidy et al., 2012a)..\\n\\nSucrose, the main carbohydrate for longdistance transport in plants, is synthesized in the mesophyll, loaded into the phloem, unloaded towards roots and cleaved into monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) to supply underground tissues. Mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots increases the sink strength and creates an additional sugar\\nThe transportome of mycorrhizal systems demand for the plant (Wright et al., 1998). Thus, a large portion of photoassimilates is redirected towards the colonized rhizos phere. These sugar fluxes are coordinated by transport systems, comprising sucrose (SUTs), monosaccharide (MSTs) and SWEET transporters. These subfamilies are key com ponents for carbon partitioning in plants, and for their interactions with microorga nisms .

These sugar fluxes are coordinated by transport systems, comprising sucrose (SUTs), monosaccharide (MSTs) and SWEET transporters. These subfamilies are key com ponents for carbon partitioning in plants, and for their interactions with microorga nisms (Doidy et al., 2012a;Lemoine, et al., 2013;Nehls et al., 2016)..\\n\\nAll plants have a small-sized family of SUTs, classified into four different types (Sauer, 2007;Peng et al., 2014), and representing key transport systems for long distance trans port of sugar, including the loading of sucrose in source leaves, as well as the unloading towards sink organs. Sucrose export from leaves to colonized roots involves fine tuning of sucrose transporters , and representing key transport systems for long distance trans port of sugar, including the loading of sucrose in source leaves, as well as the unloading towards sink organs. Sucrose export from leaves to colonized roots involves fine tuning of sucrose transporters (Ge et al., 2008;Tejeda-Sartorius et al., 2008;Boldt et al., 2011;Nehls et al., 2016). For instance, in Medicago truncatula, expression of MtSUT1-1, MtSUT2 and MtSUT4-1 is regulated in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots when inoculated with Rhizophagus sp. . For instance, in Medicago truncatula, expression of MtSUT1-1, MtSUT2 and MtSUT4-1 is regulated in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots when inoculated with Rhizophagus sp. (Doidy et al., 2012b)..\\nIn AM roots from tomato and rice, SlSUT2 and OsSUT4 seem to mediate sugar back-transport towards plant cells (Bitterlich et al., 2014a(Bitterlich et al., , 2014b)), suggesting a mechanism of sucrose retrieval for the con trol of photosynthate export towards arbus cular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Up to now, a single sut1 knockdown mutant with impaired sucrose export from source leaves in potato has been investigated in mycorrhi zal conditions, and showed no effect on fun gal colonization rates , suggesting a mechanism of sucrose retrieval for the con trol of photosynthate export towards arbus cular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Up to now, a single sut1 knockdown mutant with impaired sucrose export from source leaves in potato has been investigated in mycorrhi zal conditions, and showed no effect on fun gal colonization rates (Gabriel-Neumann et al., 2011). This result suggests that sucrose export from source leaves by SUT is not the bottleneck of the mycorrhizal-driven sink.. This result suggests that sucrose export from source leaves by SUT is not the bottleneck of the mycorrhizal-driven sink.\\n\\nIn sink organs, transport of monosaccharides resulting from the sucrose cleavage by plant invertases (Nehls et al., 2016) is mediated by a large family of MSTs  is mediated by a large family of MSTs (Johnson and Thomas, 2007;Lalonde and Frommer, 2012). Despite the fact that transferred carbon seems to be mainly taken up by the fungus in the form of glucose, most studies focused only on the expression of plant MSTs to pinpoint differ entially regulated candidates . Despite the fact that transferred carbon seems to be mainly taken up by the fungus in the form of glucose, most studies focused only on the expression of plant MSTs to pinpoint differ entially regulated candidates (Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2005) depending on fungal inoculates  depending on fungal inoculates (Ge et al., 2008) and plant varie ties  and plant varie ties (Wright et al., 2005)..\\nOnly a limited number of plant sugar transporters were characterized and located in AM-colonized root parts (Harrison, 1996;Gaude et al., 2011;Bitterlich et al., 2014a). Interestingly, such MSTs (MtSt1 and MtHext1) were also differentially regulated in noncolonized cells neighboring arbuscular cells.

Within each species, distinct MSTs are responsible for sugar uptake from biotrophic interfaces and soil-growing myce lium, and for sugar partitioning within fun gal structures.\\nIn AMF, RiMST2 is primarily expressed in symbiotic intraradical structures, and its silencing by host-induced gene silencing resulted in impaired mycorrhizal forma tion, malformed arbuscules, and reduced phosphate transporter (MtPT4) expression (Helber et al., 2011). RiMST2 is, so far, the only transporter shown to directly mediate sugar uptake at mycorrhizal interfaces. However, the silencing of RiMST2 did not completely prevent a functional symbiosis, suggesting that other transporters may be involved in sugar uptake towards the fungus. Finally, a putative sucrose trans porter (RiSUC1) has also been identified in the genome of R. irregularis but, as no sucrose uptake by ecto-and endomycorr hizal fungi has been observed, the role of such fungal sucrose transporter remains to be determined..

This N uptake is mediated by various transport systems, including transport of inorganic N as nitrate (NO 3 -) and ammonium (NH 4 + ), and of organic N as peptides and amino acids.. This N uptake is mediated by various transport systems, including transport of inorganic N as nitrate (NO 3 -) and ammonium (NH 4 + ), and of organic N as peptides and amino acids.\\n\\nNitrate is the most important source of N in soil solutions and more mobile than NH 4 + . However, due to the high energy demand needed for reduction of NO 3 to NH 4 + , direct assimilation of NH 4 + is often preferred by soil-living organisms (Marschner, 1995;Courty et al., 2015). Although NO 3 -/NH 4 + transfer through ECM is controversial between microcosm and field experiments . Although NO 3 -/NH 4 + transfer through ECM is controversial between microcosm and field experiments (Clemmensen et al., 2008;Chalot and Plassard, 2011), the ecto mycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum positively affects NO 3 -nutrition of its natu ral host Pinus pinaster , the ecto mycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum positively affects NO 3 -nutrition of its natu ral host Pinus pinaster (Plassard et al., 2000(Plassard et al., , 2002))..\\n\\nNitrate is internalized by specific, highly reg ulated transporters via an energy-dependent uptake process. In plants, huge families of nitrate and peptide transporters have been described belonging to the NPF (NRT1/PTR Family; Léran et al., 2014) and to the NRT2 and NRT3 families  and to the NRT2 and NRT3 families (Orsel et al., 2002;Tsay et al., 2007;Bai et al., 2013).

Some AM-inducible AMTs seem to be conserved among plant families, like AMT3;1, and could have evolved from a common ancestor. Others seem to have evolved independently (e.g., GmAMT1;4 or PttAMT1;2). AM-induced AMT genes were detected in arbusculated cells, more pre cisely on the branch domain of periarbuscu lar membranes, but not on the trunk region (LjAMT2;2, SbAMT3;1, GmAMT4;1), indicat ing that active NH 4 + transfer occurs around arbuscular branches by recruiting NH 4 + in the acidic periarbuscular space and releasing the uncharged NH 3 into the cytoplasm of the arbusculated cells. Thus, protons coming from the deprotonation process remain in the periarbuscular space, and could rein force the gradient for H + -dependent trans port processes.\\nObservation of some AM-induced AMTs in non-colonized cortical cells near arbuscu lated cells (M. truncatula; Gomez et al., 2009;Gaude et al., 2011;SbAMT3;1) suggests a role in the pre-penetration response. suggests a role in the pre-penetration response.\\nIn addition to the AMTs, some aquaporins, such as Nod 26-like intrinsic protein, were reported to act as low-affinity ammonium transporters in AM symbiosis (see below).\\n\\nAmmonium has been shown to be used by mycorrhizal fungi (Rangel-Castro et al., 2002).

Another hypothesis is that voltage-dependent cation channels could play a role in the export of inorganic N .

The regulation of mycorrhiza-inducible Pi transporter genes is conserved between perennial woody and herbaceous plant species (Loth-Pereda et al., 2011)..\\nThe upregulation of AM-inducible plant Pi transporters is often accompanied by the downregulation of other Pi transporters -in particular, those thought to be involved in direct Pi uptake (Liu, Trieu, et al., 1998;Rausch et al., 2001;Paszkowski et al., 2002). This interplay between Pht1 transporters may reflect the balance between direct and mycorrhizal pathways of Pi uptake . This interplay between Pht1 transporters may reflect the balance between direct and mycorrhizal pathways of Pi uptake (Smith, Smith, et al., 2003). However, it is still not clear whether the downregulation results indirectly from the improvement of Pi acqui sition, or from a direct downregulation by the plant as a response to the symbiosis..

In addition to their function in K + acquisi tion, some Trks can also transport Na + cati ons, suggesting their involvement in either Na + nutrition or fungal cell detoxification . In addition to their function in K + acquisi tion, some Trks can also transport Na + cati ons, suggesting their involvement in either Na + nutrition or fungal cell detoxification (Corratgé et al., 2007;Corratgé-Faillie et al., 2010).

Interestingly, although at least one Trk is present in all sequenced ECM fungi, none can be found in the AM fungus R. irregularis (Garcia and Zimmermann, 2014). However, one HAK transporter was detected in R. irregularis, suggesting that RiHAK is probably the main player of K + uptake in this AM fungus.

Strong efforts are now needed to decipher the whole molecular basis of K + mobilization, translocation and release to the host in mycorrhizal fungi.\\nPlant K + transport systems are well described but no molecular data are availa ble concerning their role at the plantfungus interface. Interestingly, a putative K + uptake (KUP) transporter was upre gulated 44-fold in AM colonized roots of L. japonicus (Guether et al., 2009).

Water move ment occurs by a gradient-driven flow through membranes, a process which is mediated and regulated by water channels called aquaporins (AQPs) (Luu and Maurel, 2005)..\\nAQPs are a family of pore-forming inte gral membrane proteins belonging to the family of MIPs (Major Intrinsic Proteins), present in all living organisms, and forming large families in plants. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, AQPs can be divided into five subfamilies (Maurel et al., 2008)::\\n• Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs); • Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs); • NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), first identified in the symbiosomes of legumes but also present in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER); • Small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) found in the ER only in dicots; and • Uncharacterized intrinsic proteins (XIPs), localized in the plasma membrane.\\nPIPs and TIPs are thought to be involved in the regulation of root water uptake under drought conditions (Ruiz-Lozano et al., 2012)..\\nBesides their importance in plant water relations, AQPs have also been shown to facilitate the transport of small uncharged solutes, such as glycerol, ammonia, urea, boric acid, silicic acid and carbon dioxide (Maurel et al., 2008)..\\nAquaporins with a conserved structure and similarity have also been identified in fungal genomes. Recently, several phyloge netical analyses have demonstrated the diversity of these fungal aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins (Nehls and Dietz, 2014;Verma et al., 2014). The presence of several aquaporins in fungi (e.g., five or seven in H. cylindrosporum or in L. bicolor, respec tively) is interesting, and needs to be ana lyzed in more detail to discern functional specialization and specific expression and regulation.. The presence of several aquaporins in fungi (e.g., five or seven in H. cylindrosporum or in L. bicolor, respec tively) is interesting, and needs to be ana lyzed in more detail to discern functional specialization and specific expression and regulation.\\n\\nThe role of aquaporins for mycorrhizal sym bioses has been mainly described for plant proteins in AM associations (Aroca et al., 2007;Uehlein et al., 2007), but also for ECM symbiosis , but also for ECM symbiosis (LeQuéré et al., 2005;Marjanović et al., 2005). Recently, however, the rele vance of fungal aquaporins for the function ing of ECM symbiosis has been demonstrated for an aquaporin of L. bicolor by an overexpression approach . Recently, however, the rele vance of fungal aquaporins for the function ing of ECM symbiosis has been demonstrated for an aquaporin of L. bicolor by an overexpression approach (Xu et al., 2015)..\\nThe first studies concerning the involve ment of the AM symbiosis in the modulation of plant AQPs showed mycorrhiza-induced expression of TIPs in Petroselinum crispum and M. truncatula, respectively (Roussel et al., 1997;Krajinski et al., 2000). The importance of AQPs for the efficiency of the AM symbio sis under drought conditions was demon strated in tobacco by Ntaqp1 antisense mutants . The importance of AQPs for the efficiency of the AM symbio sis under drought conditions was demon strated in tobacco by Ntaqp1 antisense mutants (Porcel et al., 2006)..\\nIn ECM poplar plants, an increase in the water transport capacity of mycorrhizal roots was correlated with an upregulation of several PIP-encoding genes (Marjanović et al., 2005). Interestingly, opposite results were observed in ECM birch roots, where two genes related to water-stress response, BpPIP1 and BpPIP2, were downregulated . Interestingly, opposite results were observed in ECM birch roots, where two genes related to water-stress response, BpPIP1 and BpPIP2, were downregulated (LeQuéré et al., 2005). Thus, AM and ECM symbioses lead to both an increased or decreased expression of AQP genes. Facilitated water transport in symbiotic association might be linked to increased membrane water permeability, which requires upregulation of AQPs under drought stress . Thus, AM and ECM symbioses lead to both an increased or decreased expression of AQP genes. Facilitated water transport in symbiotic association might be linked to increased membrane water permeability, which requires upregulation of AQPs under drought stress (Yu et al., 2005).

Particular AQP regulation patterns detected in colo nized roots were related to an overall improvement of drought tolerance, as reflected by improved growth and water status of mycorrhizal plants ( Ruiz-Lozano et al., 2012). Differential regulation of AQP encoding genes by AM symbiosis and drought conditions has been observed for three out of four PIPs in R. irregularis-inocu lated Phaseolus vulgaris roots . Differential regulation of AQP encoding genes by AM symbiosis and drought conditions has been observed for three out of four PIPs in R. irregularis-inocu lated Phaseolus vulgaris roots (Aroca et al., 2007)..\\nIn addition, it has been suggested that the role of AQPs in AM and ECM symbioses might be more complex, also involving sym biotic exchange of ammonia (Uehlein et al., 2007)..\\n\\nSymbiotic exchange between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots also involves uptake and transfer of other elements, with Fe, Cu, Zn, Ca and Mg playing essential and cata lytic roles throughout the cell in various subcellular compartments (Casieri et al., 2013). Fine regulation of their biological concentrations is mediated by specialized transporter systems. So far, few studies have revealed functional characterization of such transporters mostly upon isolation from fungal strains living in polluted soils . Fine regulation of their biological concentrations is mediated by specialized transporter systems. So far, few studies have revealed functional characterization of such transporters mostly upon isolation from fungal strains living in polluted soils (Göhre and Paszkowski, 2006).

A genome-wide analysis revealed copper, iron and zinc transporters in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregularis (Tamayo et al., 2014)..\\n\\nImproved nutrient availability for plants and fungi is one of the main features of mycor rhiza. Nutrient uptake at the soil-fungus interface, as well as coordinated exchange between both partners at the plant-fungus interface formed by mycorrhiza, include dif ferentiated expression and/or concerted reg ulation of a high number of specialized membrane transport systems of the fungal and plant partners. So far, molecular players have been identified and characterized more on the plant side in AM and more on the fungal side in ECM (see Table 14.1).

Improved plant mineral nutrition through the fungal part ner was first described a long time ago; in return, the plant delivers carbon substrates to the fungal partner. The first transport sys tems involved in plant-microorganism inter actions in plants and fungi were also identified years ago.\\nWithin this chapter, recent knowledge concerning mycorrhizal nutrient exchanges and the involved molecular players in membrane transport of the ecto-and endo mycorrhizal partners will be presented. First, transport of sugars from plants towards mycorrhizal fungi is summarized. Then, uptake and exchange of main nutri ents such as nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, potassium, and water by the symbiotic partners will be reviewed.\\n\\nIn the mycorrhizal associations, in return for mineral nutrient provisioning, the plant provides sugar photosynthates to the heter otrophic symbiont. This trade is regulated by both plant and fungal transport components, as for instance the long-distance transport of sucrose from leaves towards mycorrhizal roots and subsequent cellular transfer of monosaccharides at the symbiotic interface (Doidy et al., 2012a)..\\n\\nSucrose, the main carbohydrate for longdistance transport in plants, is synthesized in the mesophyll, loaded into the phloem, unloaded towards roots and cleaved into monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) to supply underground tissues. Mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots increases the sink strength and creates an additional sugar\\nThe transportome of mycorrhizal systems demand for the plant (Wright et al., 1998). Thus, a large portion of photoassimilates is redirected towards the colonized rhizos phere. These sugar fluxes are coordinated by transport systems, comprising sucrose (SUTs), monosaccharide (MSTs) and SWEET transporters. These subfamilies are key com ponents for carbon partitioning in plants, and for their interactions with microorga nisms .

Sucrose export from leaves to colonized roots involves fine tuning of sucrose transporters , and representing key transport systems for long distance trans port of sugar, including the loading of sucrose in source leaves, as well as the unloading towards sink organs. Sucrose export from leaves to colonized roots involves fine tuning of sucrose transporters (Ge et al., 2008;Tejeda-Sartorius et al., 2008;Boldt et al., 2011;Nehls et al., 2016). For instance, in Medicago truncatula, expression of MtSUT1-1, MtSUT2 and MtSUT4-1 is regulated in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots when inoculated with Rhizophagus sp. .

Up to now, a single sut1 knockdown mutant with impaired sucrose export from source leaves in potato has been investigated in mycorrhi zal conditions, and showed no effect on fun gal colonization rates (Gabriel-Neumann et al., 2011). This result suggests that sucrose export from source leaves by SUT is not the bottleneck of the mycorrhizal-driven sink.. This result suggests that sucrose export from source leaves by SUT is not the bottleneck of the mycorrhizal-driven sink.\\n\\nIn sink organs, transport of monosaccharides resulting from the sucrose cleavage by plant invertases (Nehls et al., 2016) is mediated by a large family of MSTs  is mediated by a large family of MSTs (Johnson and Thomas, 2007;Lalonde and Frommer, 2012).

Interestingly, such MSTs (MtSt1 and MtHext1) were also differentially regulated in noncolonized cells neighboring arbuscular cells. The sugar flow in non-colonized adjacent cells may be directed to feed arbuscular cells through symplasmic pathways..

Within each species, distinct MSTs are responsible for sugar uptake from biotrophic interfaces and soil-growing myce lium, and for sugar partitioning within fun gal structures.\\nIn AMF, RiMST2 is primarily expressed in symbiotic intraradical structures, and its silencing by host-induced gene silencing resulted in impaired mycorrhizal forma tion, malformed arbuscules, and reduced phosphate transporter (MtPT4) expression (Helber et al., 2011). RiMST2 is, so far, the only transporter shown to directly mediate sugar uptake at mycorrhizal interfaces. However, the silencing of RiMST2 did not completely prevent a functional symbiosis, suggesting that other transporters may be involved in sugar uptake towards the fungus. Finally, a putative sucrose trans porter (RiSUC1) has also been identified in the genome of R. irregularis but, as no sucrose uptake by ecto-and endomycorr hizal fungi has been observed, the role of such fungal sucrose transporter remains to be determined..

This N uptake is mediated by various transport systems, including transport of inorganic N as nitrate (NO 3 -) and ammonium (NH 4 + ), and of organic N as peptides and amino acids.. This N uptake is mediated by various transport systems, including transport of inorganic N as nitrate (NO 3 -) and ammonium (NH 4 + ), and of organic N as peptides and amino acids.\\n\\nNitrate is the most important source of N in soil solutions and more mobile than NH 4 + . However, due to the high energy demand needed for reduction of NO 3 to NH 4 + , direct assimilation of NH 4 + is often preferred by soil-living organisms (Marschner, 1995;Courty et al., 2015).

Although NO 3 -/NH 4 + transfer through ECM is controversial between microcosm and field experiments (Clemmensen et al., 2008;Chalot and Plassard, 2011), the ecto mycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum positively affects NO 3 -nutrition of its natu ral host Pinus pinaster , the ecto mycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum positively affects NO 3 -nutrition of its natu ral host Pinus pinaster (Plassard et al., 2000(Plassard et al., , 2002))..\\n\\nNitrate is internalized by specific, highly reg ulated transporters via an energy-dependent uptake process. In plants, huge families of nitrate and peptide transporters have been described belonging to the NPF (NRT1/PTR Family; Léran et al., 2014) and to the NRT2 and NRT3 families  and to the NRT2 and NRT3 families (Orsel et al., 2002;Tsay et al., 2007;Bai et al., 2013).

Some AM-inducible AMTs seem to be conserved among plant families, like AMT3;1, and could have evolved from a common ancestor. Others seem to have evolved independently (e.g., GmAMT1;4 or PttAMT1;2). AM-induced AMT genes were detected in arbusculated cells, more pre cisely on the branch domain of periarbuscu lar membranes, but not on the trunk region (LjAMT2;2, SbAMT3;1, GmAMT4;1), indicat ing that active NH 4 + transfer occurs around arbuscular branches by recruiting NH 4 + in the acidic periarbuscular space and releasing the uncharged NH 3 into the cytoplasm of the arbusculated cells. Thus, protons coming from the deprotonation process remain in the periarbuscular space, and could rein force the gradient for H + -dependent trans port processes.\\nObservation of some AM-induced AMTs in non-colonized cortical cells near arbuscu lated cells (M. truncatula; Gomez et al., 2009;Gaude et al., 2011;SbAMT3;1) suggests a role in the pre-penetration response. suggests a role in the pre-penetration response.\\nIn addition to the AMTs, some aquaporins, such as Nod 26-like intrinsic protein, were reported to act as low-affinity ammonium transporters in AM symbiosis (see below).\\n\\nAmmonium has been shown to be used by mycorrhizal fungi (Rangel-Castro et al., 2002).

The regulation of mycorrhiza-inducible Pi transporter genes is conserved between perennial woody and herbaceous plant species (Loth-Pereda et al., 2011)..\\nThe upregulation of AM-inducible plant Pi transporters is often accompanied by the downregulation of other Pi transporters -in particular, those thought to be involved in direct Pi uptake (Liu, Trieu, et al., 1998;Rausch et al., 2001;Paszkowski et al., 2002). This interplay between Pht1 transporters may reflect the balance between direct and mycorrhizal pathways of Pi uptake . This interplay between Pht1 transporters may reflect the balance between direct and mycorrhizal pathways of Pi uptake (Smith, Smith, et al., 2003). However, it is still not clear whether the downregulation results indirectly from the improvement of Pi acqui sition, or from a direct downregulation by the plant as a response to the symbiosis..

Water move ment occurs by a gradient-driven flow through membranes, a process which is mediated and regulated by water channels called aquaporins (AQPs) (Luu and Maurel, 2005)..\\nAQPs are a family of pore-forming inte gral membrane proteins belonging to the family of MIPs (Major Intrinsic Proteins), present in all living organisms, and forming large families in plants. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, AQPs can be divided into five subfamilies (Maurel et al., 2008)::\\n• Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs); • Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs); • NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), first identified in the symbiosomes of legumes but also present in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER); • Small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) found in the ER only in dicots; and • Uncharacterized intrinsic proteins (XIPs), localized in the plasma membrane.\\nPIPs and TIPs are thought to be involved in the regulation of root water uptake under drought conditions (Ruiz-Lozano et al., 2012)..\\nBesides their importance in plant water relations, AQPs have also been shown to facilitate the transport of small uncharged solutes, such as glycerol, ammonia, urea, boric acid, silicic acid and carbon dioxide (Maurel et al., 2008)..\\nAquaporins with a conserved structure and similarity have also been identified in fungal genomes. Recently, several phyloge netical analyses have demonstrated the diversity of these fungal aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins (Nehls and Dietz, 2014;Verma et al., 2014). The presence of several aquaporins in fungi (e.g., five or seven in H. cylindrosporum or in L. bicolor, respec tively) is interesting, and needs to be ana lyzed in more detail to discern functional specialization and specific expression and regulation..

Interestingly, opposite results were observed in ECM birch roots, where two genes related to water-stress response, BpPIP1 and BpPIP2, were downregulated (LeQuéré et al., 2005). Thus, AM and ECM symbioses lead to both an increased or decreased expression of AQP genes. Facilitated water transport in symbiotic association might be linked to increased membrane water permeability, which requires upregulation of AQPs under drought stress . Thus, AM and ECM symbioses lead to both an increased or decreased expression of AQP genes. Facilitated water transport in symbiotic association might be linked to increased membrane water permeability, which requires upregulation of AQPs under drought stress (Yu et al., 2005).

Particular AQP regulation patterns detected in colo nized roots were related to an overall improvement of drought tolerance, as reflected by improved growth and water status of mycorrhizal plants ( Ruiz-Lozano et al., 2012). Differential regulation of AQP encoding genes by AM symbiosis and drought conditions has been observed for three out of four PIPs in R. irregularis-inocu lated Phaseolus vulgaris roots . Differential regulation of AQP encoding genes by AM symbiosis and drought conditions has been observed for three out of four PIPs in R. irregularis-inocu lated Phaseolus vulgaris roots (Aroca et al., 2007)..\\nIn addition, it has been suggested that the role of AQPs in AM and ECM symbioses might be more complex, also involving sym biotic exchange of ammonia (Uehlein et al., 2007)..\\n\\nSymbiotic exchange between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots also involves uptake and transfer of other elements, with Fe, Cu, Zn, Ca and Mg playing essential and cata lytic roles throughout the cell in various subcellular compartments (Casieri et al., 2013). Fine regulation of their biological concentrations is mediated by specialized transporter systems. So far, few studies have revealed functional characterization of such transporters mostly upon isolation from fungal strains living in polluted soils . Fine regulation of their biological concentrations is mediated by specialized transporter systems. So far, few studies have revealed functional characterization of such transporters mostly upon isolation from fungal strains living in polluted soils (Göhre and Paszkowski, 2006). A genome-wide analysis revealed copper, iron and zinc transporters in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregularis . A genome-wide analysis revealed copper, iron and zinc transporters in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregularis (Tamayo et al., 2014)..\\n\\nImproved nutrient availability for plants and fungi is one of the main features of mycor rhiza. Nutrient uptake at the soil-fungus interface, as well as coordinated exchange between both partners at the plant-fungus interface formed by mycorrhiza, include dif ferentiated expression and/or concerted reg ulation of a high number of specialized membrane transport systems of the fungal and plant partners. So far, molecular players have been identified and characterized more on the plant side in AM and more on the fungal side in ECM (see Table 14.1). Massive sequencing of genomes of symbiotic micro organisms .1). Massive sequencing of genomes of symbiotic micro organisms (Kohler et al., 2015) and plant hosts currently allows the identification of the whole transportome putatively involved in symbiotic transport, and will conse quently enable analysis of the functioning and regulation of transport processes at the symbiotic interfaces -a major step towards a better understanding of the agroecolo gical outcome of plant-fungal interactions  and plant hosts currently allows the identification of the whole transportome putatively involved in symbiotic transport, and will conse quently enable analysis of the functioning and regulation of transport processes at the symbiotic interfaces -a major step towards a better understanding of the agroecolo gical outcome of plant-fungal interactions (Gianinazzi et al., 2010)..\\n\\nAi P, Sun S, Zhao J, Fan X, Xin W, Guo Q, Yu L, Shen Q, Wu P, Miller AJ, Xu G.

With the use Acetone based extraction method, the yield of mucilage was found to be 1.44%. Characterization of the extracted mucilage was done by various parameters such as micromeritic studies, flow behavior, organoleptic properties, surface tension and viscosity, loss on drying, ash value and swelling index. The result showed that extracted Opuntia stricta mucilage exhibited good flow properties (Angle of repose 25.30 • ), the surface tension of 2.85% w/v solutions of mucilage was found to be 70.20 N/m, total ash was 28.33% w/w, loss on drying was 13% and pH was found to be in the range of 7.2-7.4. Extracted mucilage was soluble in warm water and slightly soluble in cold water while insoluble in organic solvents except chloroform. Phytochemical screening and powder characteristics of extracted mucilage powder of Opuntia stricta cladodes showed that it can be safely used in dosage form without causing any adverse effect.\\n\\nNatural polymers are commonly obtained from plant sources. They are high molecular weight; water soluble polymers made up of monosaccharide unit and joined by glycosidic bond. Gummy excaudate of natural polymers such as protein, enzyme, muscle, fibers, polysaccharide have been used to formulate various pharmaceutical products. The well-known natural polymers are aloe mucilage, guar gum, karaya gum, bhara gum, okra gum and linseed mucilage. Mucilage is a complex carbohydrate. [1][2][3][4][5][6] These natural polymers are used in formulation of different pharmaceutical dosage forms like matrix controlled system, sustained release drugs, microsphere, nanoparticle, buccal film and viscous liquid formulation. The specific application of natural polysaccharide in pharmaceutical preparations is to aid in the processing of the drug delivery system during its manufacture, its protection, its stability, its bioavailability and its patient acceptance. Gum has obtained from hydrocolloids of plant and can be classified into two groups' i.e. anionic and non-ionic polysaccharides. Hence by modification gum can alter their physicochemical properties. Mucilage is a metabolized product which is intracellularly formed without injury to the plant. Gums are readily soluble in water while mucilage forms slimy mass in the presence of water. Gum and mucus are translucent and amorphous substances that plants produce as protection against injury.

They are high molecular weight; water soluble polymers made up of monosaccharide unit and joined by glycosidic bond. Gummy excaudate of natural polymers such as protein, enzyme, muscle, fibers, polysaccharide have been used to formulate various pharmaceutical products. The well-known natural polymers are aloe mucilage, guar gum, karaya gum, bhara gum, okra gum and linseed mucilage. Mucilage is a complex carbohydrate. [1][2][3][4][5][6] These natural polymers are used in formulation of different pharmaceutical dosage forms like matrix controlled system, sustained release drugs, microsphere, nanoparticle, buccal film and viscous liquid formulation. The specific application of natural polysaccharide in pharmaceutical preparations is to aid in the processing of the drug delivery system during its manufacture, its protection, its stability, its bioavailability and its patient acceptance. Gum has obtained from hydrocolloids of plant and can be classified into two groups' i.e. anionic and non-ionic polysaccharides. Hence by modification gum can alter their physicochemical properties. Mucilage is a metabolized product which is intracellularly formed without injury to the plant. Gums are readily soluble in water while mucilage forms slimy mass in the presence of water. Gum and mucus are translucent and amorphous substances that plants produce as protection against injury.
