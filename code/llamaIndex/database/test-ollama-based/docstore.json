It consists of progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its onset was correlated with aging, toxic events, and metabolic causes. There is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance in Parkinson's disease, although a genetic component was incriminated in a small percentage of cases. There is strong evidence that it may be caused largely by oxidative stress and metal toxicity; patients have low levels of natural antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and high leve ls of iron in the substantia nigra and other areas of their brain, leading to the hypothesis that iron and other transition metals help catalyze the free radical reactions that destroy the dopaminergic neurons, and that high levels of antioxidants (e.g., uric acid, flavonoids, ubiquinone) may help prevent or slow down the progress of Parkinson's disease. This review paper is dedicated to analyzing this hypothesis and also attempts to define possible future directions of investigation.", "Introduction": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic illness due to the progressive degeneration of those neurons that normally produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to a dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. It is characterized by the following symptoms: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement) or akinesia (absence or difficulty in initiating movement), shuffling gait, and stooped posture; depression or dementia may also be present at later stages.\nThe most characteristic symptom, the accentuated tremor, led the British physician who first described this disease in 1817, James Parkinson, to name it \"shaking palsy\". Parkinson's disease is more common among men than among women and is four times more frequent in Caucasians than in darkly pigmented races. In the United States, PD affects about 1% of the population over age 60 [1]. Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed . Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause.

The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed [1]. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect. Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are also used. Avaiable surgical techniques are either ablative (thalamotomy and pallidotomy), augmentative (high-frequency deep-brain stimulation) or restaurative (gene therapy and neurotransplantation). Additiona l adjunctive therapies include physical therapy and nutritional counseling. However, the treatment is not curative; it can only relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease .

There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease [1]..\nThe remainder of this review paper is devoted to a brief anatomical background and to the analysis of the current hypothesis of the international research community stating that free radical toxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.", "Pathological anatomy": "The basal ganglia are a conglomeration of five distinguishable interconnected nuclei located at the base of the brain: the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum (consisting of caudate nucleus and putamen) and the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia became known as a component of the so-called extrapyramidal system, which is interconnected and cooperates with the pyramidal (corticospinal) system. The basal ganglia play an important role in voluntary movement and also have a role in cognitive function [2]..\nThe substantia nigra is a pigmented mass of neurons located in the midbrain (mesencephalon) between the cerebral peduncles and the tegmentum. It is composed of a dorsal pars compacta containing melanin pigment, a ventral pars reticulata containing iron compounds, and a pars lateralis. The dendrites of neurons in the pars compacta arborize in the pars reticulata. The neuronal population of the substantia nigra consists of pigmented and nonpigmented neurons. Pigmented neurons outnumber nonpigmented neurons two to one. The neurotransmitter in pigmented neurons is dopamine. Nonpigmented neurons are either cholinergic or GABAergic. There is a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in different disease states. Both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons are lost in patients with Huntington's chorea, another neurodegenerative disease of basal ganglia origin, which differs from PD in that it is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Only pigmented (dopaminergic) neurons are lost in PD. In idiopathic PD this loss occurs mostly in the center of the substantia nigra, while in the postencephalitic type of PD the pattern is uniform throughout the substantia nigra [2]. Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) . Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) [2]..\nIn postmortem studies it was discovered that the substantia nigra (meaning \"black substance\") had lost its pigment in PD patients. The pigment is called neuromelanin and was commented on as long ago as 1786 by Vicq d'Azyr. Apart from the substantia nigra, neuromelanin is also located in the locus coeruleus in the pons, where the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. It is certain, however, that neuromelanin is a recent phylogenetic development and it appears that the intensity of pigmentation is related to the degree of evolution of the brain.\nNeuromelanin is present only in the brain of humans, primates and some carnivores, e.g. the dog and the cat; it does not appear to be present in the brain of common laboratory animals, such as the rat, the guinea pig, and the rabbit. Evidence suggests that neuromelanin is not synthesized by a tyrosine-tyrosinase system as in skin melanocytes, but by a different pathway involving oxidation of brain catecholamines, in particular dopamine. Moreover, there is a striking similarity between the distribution of neuromelanin and that of the brain catecholaminesnorepinephrine and dopamine [3]. These anatomical findings inevitably led to the conclusion that melanin in neurons is intimately related to the ability of these cells to synthesize dopamine or norepinephrine. Indeed, neuromelanin may be looked upon as an indication of catecholamine synthesis in neuronal systems containing dopamine or norepinephrine. The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species .

The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species [3]..\nNeuromelanin has a strict anatomical localization and a late evolutionary appearance which suggest that it serves some positive function. Melanin deposition may provide a mechanism of inactivation of some metabolic product possibly of catecholamine origin which cannot be removed from neurons by other means. Alternatively, the chemical constituents of melanin, in particular the heavy metals it contains -zinc, copper, iron, manganese, titanium, cobalt, and nickel -may influence neuronal metabolism. A significant feature of neuromelanin is the presence of free semiquinone radicals, which might influence oxidation-reduction reactions [3]..\nParkinson's disease affects the cytoskeleton and damage occurs only in selectively vulnerable neurons. As a result of the cytoskeletal changes, the so-called Le wy bodies may appear; their major components are abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments, in other words altered \"building blocks\" of the cytoskeleton. The Lewy bodies are concentric hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions seen in pigmented nigral cells, but not in all cases of PD (e.g., not in those cases following encephalitis letargica) [3]..", "Physiopathology": "Parkinsonism may occur following carbon monoxide poisoning or cranial trauma ( e.g. dementia pugilistica, a condition seen in professional boxers such as Muhammad Ali).\nParkinson's disease may also develop later in life, in connection with a neurotoxic event that occurred at an early age, e.g. encephalitis lethargica or a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic infection. Certain diuretics (e.g. reserpine), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (e.g. naproxen), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) and \"designer drugs\" (e.g. MPTP) have all been implicated in causing or exacerbating PD. Environmental and dietary factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, i.e. occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides, the high intake of animal fats, the high intake of sugars (mono-and disaccharides), the high aluminum content of drinking water, the mercury from dental amalgams, the presence of other metals, notably manganese, cadmium and copper, as well as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. multiple lacunar strokes) [4]..\nA consensus is now emerging that major causes of neurodegenerative diseases in general, and PD in particular, are oxidative stress (i.e., an excess of free radicals) and metal toxicity [5]..\nThe following section of this paper is devoted to the critical review of this hypothesis. In relation to this hypothesis, one of the above-mentioned causative factors, MPTP, is entitled to a special discussion. MPTP-induced parkinsonism is a model for PD in human and non-human primates and was discovered accidentally. In 1982, several heroin addicts in California and Maryland suddenly developed acute and permanent parkinsonism after injecting a synthetic opiate containing the impurity MPTP. The symptoms required constant levodopa treatment ever since. MPTP is converted by the neuronal enzyme MAO-B into its toxic metabolite MPP + which has structural similarities to dopamine and is taken up into the dopaminergic nerve terminal by the dopamine uptake system where it causes cell damage. Another drug, selegiline (or deprenyl), an almost forgotten substance that was invented by a Hungarian scientist and failed its purpose as an antidepressant, was found to have antagonist actions to MPTP since it is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, preventing dopamine depletion and PD symptoms [6]. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.", "Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease": "One of the leading hypotheses nowadays is that oxidative stress by ROS damages essential components of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, including DNA, protein structures and the cell membrane, resulting in functional disruption and ultimate cell death. These free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism, but specific cellular detoxification systems normally minimize their damaging effects [7]. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:\n1) increased membrane peroxidation in the SNc and widespread ROS-induced protein modification, with protein carbonyl levels elevated in all regions of the brain [7,8];;\n2) elevated TBA-reactive substance levels (a measure of the secondary products of lipid peroxidation) accompanied by decreased PUFA levels (the peroxidation substrate) [8];;\n3) increased 8-hydroxy-2\u2032deoxyguanosine levels in the SNc and other brain regions, indicative of ROS-mediated DNA damage [7,9]. Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage . Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage [10]..\nThere are several potential metabolic sources of increased oxidative stress in PD: dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free iron levels, accumulation of AGEs, reduced activity of free radical defense systems, and the deleterious role of glial cells. Several toxins may also be implicated in PD. A brief discussion is devoted to each of these hypotheses.", "1) Dopamine metabolism": "Dopamine is oxidized in the brain via two pathways. a) Auto-oxidation of dopamine leads to the production of toxic semiquinone species (SQ \u2022 ), which via a metabolic cascade can be polymerized to neuromelanin. Little can be said with certainty about the effect of neuromelanin on neuronal function. It is generally regarded as a waste product of dopamine auto-oxidation and as a \"double-edged sword\" with respect to free radical reactions, in that it sequesters redox-active metal ions (such as iron), but may also promote ROS-generating processes and may also represent a depot for other cellular toxins, such as MPP + [11]. b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is: . b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is:\nAlso, MAO-B, but not MAO-A, is found at an increased level (approximately 25% higher) in the SN of PD patients; MAO-B in blood platelets is significantly higher in PD and Alzheimer's disease [6]. This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A . This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A [6]. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.", "2) Mitochondrial dysfunction": "Evidence implying that mitochondria have a crucial role in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is accumulating rapidly. Both these conditions are distinctive forms of cell death, as defined morphologically; however, in neuronal populations and diseases such as PD they can either coexist or be sequential events. Fig. 1 (from  (from [12]) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. ) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. 1a depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig.  depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig. 1b depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation). The nature of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is still undetermined, but there are indications that it involves a combination of apoptotic processes and necrotic degeneration. It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration  depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation).

It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration [7]..\nThe CNS has a particularly high energy requirement, thus making it very susceptible to  One of the known substrates of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD consists of abnormalities of the respiratory chain (schematically drawn in Fig. 2, from , from [13]). The respiratory chain consists of five complexes aligned along the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The functions of the respiratory chain are proton pumping, electron transport, conversion of atomic oxygen into water, and, most importantly, production of energy in the form of ATP. In total, the five enzyme complexes are formed by more than 80 subunits; 13 of these are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the others by nuclear DNA. In MPTP-induced parkinsonism, MPTP is metabolized to MPP + which is preferentially stored in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, where it inhibits complex I of the electron-transport chain, leading to reductions in ATP production and elevated ROS generation, which in turn result in oxidative damage to various cell structures ).

Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD . Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [12]. In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN . In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN [12,14] and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically  and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically [15]. Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering . Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering [12,16]. It is now generally accepted that PD patients present a complex I defect in their substantia nigra.

The question of whether this defect is primary or secondary (i.e., the result of toxic, oxidative or other damage) is currently the focus of intensive research.", "Increased free iron levels": "The normal basal ganglia are rich in iron, with highest levels in the SN, globus pallidus and putamen. Absolute iron levels are increased in PD by about 35%, specifically in the SNc [18]..\nOf particular significance in PD is the shift in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio from almost 2:1 to 1:2 [18], consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction , consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction [10]::\nThe reduction of Fe(III) by the superoxide radical would increase the rate of the Fenton reaction, thus driving the Haber-Weiss cycle-mediated production of \u2022 OH (4) [7]::\nThe availability of soluble iron complexes for participation in this reaction is a major determinant of the toxicity of ROS in the neuron. Iron participates in free radical-generating reactions only in the free, ferrous form. Ferric iron in the SNc is normally bound either by ferritin (about 90%) or by neuromelanin (10%). A variety of molecules with an o-dihydroxyphenyl structure (including 6-OHDA and dopamine) effectively release ferritin-bound iron in vitro and thereby stimulate lipid peroxidation [7,19]; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine ; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine [20]..\nIn animal models, infusion of iron into the SNc induced neurodegeneration and a dose-related decline in striatal dopamine. In PD, it is not known whether the increased iron levels are due to reduced ferritin levels or increased cellular uptake of iron. It is considered unlikely that iron is involved early in the pathogenesis of PD, since laboratory tests have not indicated elevated levels of iron in the preclinical stage of the disease, however, its potent ability to generate ROS means that it may play a significant role in the progression of PD [7], especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels , especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels [21] which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts  which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts [21]..\nIn correlation with the chemistry of iron, it was shown that the enzyme SOD may be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence comes from studies demonstrating that the inactivation of the mouse gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase leads to tissue-specific inhibition of the respiratory chain enzymes complex I and complex II, inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase and accumulation of DNA oxidative damage [22]. Complex II contains three Fe-S clusters, only one of which is tetranuclear (4Fe-4S) cluster. The inactivation of aconitase in SOD-deficient mice is likely to be caused by oxidation of its Fe-S cluster by superoxide, which liberates the iron as Fe 2+ ; this iron can then participate in the Fenton reaction, generating hydroxyl radical and leading to further oxidative damage .

Their accumulation in the ageing human brain is facilitated by oxidative stress and transition metals, including iron, and their formation is inhibited by radical scavengers and thiol antioxidants. Highly reactive dicarbonyl products and ROS are produced in the course of AGE synthesis, thus further enhancing oxidative stress. Due to these properties and their promotion of protein cross-linking, AGEs have been implicated in degenerative disorders associated with ageing in the periphery as well as in the CNS .

In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques . In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques [24], and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation , and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation [24]. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.\nHeme-oxygenase-1 immunoreactivity was localized to the filaments of Lewy bodies, suggesting a particular sensitivity of the cytoskeleton [24]..", "Reduced activity of free radical defense systems": "The cellular radical detoxification system (its most important components being SOD and GPx) is supposed to neutralize free radicals by catalyzing reactions ( 5) and ( ) and ( 6), respectively:), respectively:\nHowever, the activity of this system declines, even with normal aging, and, even in normal individuals, the neurons in the SNc are particularly vulnerable enzymatically. In the normal brain, nigral GSH levels are low in comparison with other brain regions [25]. In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN. Of the other enzymes which modulate GSH levels, only the levels of ?-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is associated with GSH translocation and degradation, are significantly different (doubled). This change is restricted to PD and the SNc . In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN.

Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.", "The deleterious actions of glial cells": "The debate focusing on the role of glial cells in PD is very interesting. Until recently, it was assumed that glial cells have a protective role, since glial cell distribution is not uniform across the brainstem: it is lowest in the areas that are prone to PD and highest in the areas where dopaminergic neurons are preserved [27]. The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx . The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx [27]..\nHowever, it was suggested recently that glial cells may damage dopaminergic neurons by secreting factors that might diffuse into neurons or act on membrane receptors. The density of glial cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, interferon ? and interleukine 1\u00df is increased in the SN in PD [28]. Cytokines were found to induce the expression of CD23, a low-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor which, following appropriate ligation, induces the expression of the enzyme NOS II that produces nitric oxide which is diffusible and may penetrate into neurons, combine with superoxide radicals and form peroxinitrates that are extremely toxic; indeed, the concentration of nitrites is increased in the CSF of PD patients .

The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.. The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.\nThe mean TNF-a level was 2.6-fold higher in CSF specimens from PD patients than in those of controls. It was shown that CSF specimens obtained by lombar puncture from these patients were cytotoxic to dopaminergic neurons in primary mesencephalic cell culture. Specimens of CSF were evaluated in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell lines for cytotoxicity by viability assay and by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. Cytotoxicity was assessed by cell structure and cell viability staining. To explore the possible involvement of apoptotic mechanisms in CSF-induced cell injury, these cells were also stained for DNA fragmentation with the TUNEL technique. A typical pattern that included nuclear chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation was apparent after incubation with CSF, suggesting the role of apoptotic mechanisms. Along with TNF-a, interleukin 1\u00df was also elevated in CSF in PD [31]..\nA summary of the potential deleterious or neuroprotective actions of glial cells is shown in Figure 3 (from  (from [27]):):\nFig. 3. The potential deleterious and neuroprotective effects of glial cells. The potential deleterious and neuroprotective effects of glial cells", "7) The generation of free radicals by toxins in PD": "The recognition that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by MPP + (and also by paraquat and 6-OHDA) not only leads to energy deficits but also the generation of O 2 ? -, ? OH and H 2 O 2 , and thus possibly to oxidative stress, stimulated the search for a \"natural\" inhibitor that might represent the causative agent in PD [7]. The possibility that an external toxin is involved was suggerated by epidemiological studies which found a greater risk for PD associated with exposure to any of a range of seemingly unrelated variables: agricultural chemicals, industrial environments, different metals.

The properties of neuromelanin will certainly have to be investigated in detail, since its chemical identity with oculocutaneous melanin has never been established. Valuable starting points are the facts that: 1) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is localized in neurons and not in melanocytes; 2) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is present (spared) in the genetic disease albinism -an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase; 3) the skin pigment seems to be a protective factor in some races against neurodegeneration, a cutaneous barrier that would bind toxins as neuromelanin binds MPP + ; 4) primary malignant mela nomas of the CNS are not recorded; 4) neuromelanin binds and accumulates heavy metals. Regarding the comparison with skin melanin, it is significant that pigmented cells called melanophores in heterothermic vertebrates (e.g. amphibians) possess dopamine receptors that mediate melanosome aggregation and melonosome dispersion, and also receptors for norepinephrine [33]. Thus the ligand-receptor type of interaction between dopamine and melanin could be further explored at epithelial and neural level; on the basis of dose-response curves, a characterization of these receptors could be attempted as a function of agonist affinity; the goal of such a research project would be the identification of several classes of receptors based on differences in their expression. The histochemical and spectroscopic properties of neuromelanin will have to be studied in detail, since the anatomical distribution, the biochemical pathways and the selective vulnerability to various diseases do not argue in favor of their chemical identity. A logical starting point would be the examination of the spatial structures of these biopolymers generally called melanins by Xray diffraction techniques in a synchrotron radiation facility, by following changes in diffraction data during polymerization or depolymerization of melanins. This may help understanding the structural changes at different levels of organization in melanins. Also, since neuromelanin contains small amounts of metals, the immediate chemical environment of the heavy atom in the melanin structure and the location of the binding sites may also be worth investigating, and the most appropriate technique would probably be EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure). The principle of EXAFS is that when X-rays traverse a sample under study, the transmitted beam suffers an attenuation which normally changes monotonically; if the sample contains a heavy atom, the attenuation increase steeply. Conventional techniques as Perls staining and transmission electron microscopy have failed to properly serve the purposes of identifying neuromelanin granules in brain slices, but a promising technique is LAMMA (laser microprobe mass analyzer), an advanced type of mass spectrophotometer; the recording of peaks corresponds to increased quantities of iron and aluminum that may exist in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it is important to note that neuromelanin is believed to coexist in granules with lipofuscin, and that the nature of their association is at present very poorly understood; a starting point for future directions of research would be the model system in which bleaching with hydrogen peroxide gradually converts the optical and histochemical properties of melanin to those of lipofuscin and the reverse, in which lipofuscin, experimentally melanized with catecholamines, acquires characteristic optical properties of neuromelanin .

Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.. Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.\nFrom the point of view of the physiologist, however, the most important issue would be function, and not structure. Recent studies have expanded the abnormalities of dopaminergic neurons well beyond the limits of the substantia nigra, and have challenged the conservative view that this is exclusively a motor system disorder. In PD, abnormal visually evoked potentials led to the conclusion that visual dysfunction is a result of dopaminergic deficiency in both humans and animals [35]. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals..

Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.\nLight stimulates retinal tyrosine hydroxylase leading to the release of dopamine. Dopamine has a role in visual adaptation and in the center-surround organization of retinal receptive fields in various mammalian species. Obviously, neurophysiological techniques using intracellular recordings would be the best method of pursuing the issue of the broader functions of dopaminergic neurons affected in PD.\nThere is also evidence of an endogenous retinal clock regulating photoreceptor sensitivity [36]. Recent data suggest circadian control of contrast sensitivity via dopaminergic mechanisms in PD. How and where the circadian regulator interacts with endogenous relase and uptake of dopamine in the visual pathway is not known. As a physiology student, the author of this paper would attempt to suggest a correlation between the role of melatonin as a regulator of the circadian rhythm and this retinal clock, as endogenous melatonin levels decline with age and its role may be partly overtaken, in order to maintain the usual sleep-wakefulness cycle, by other systems in the body, notably the dopaminergic system of neural transmission; when suffering of PD, this might affect elderly individuals. It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep..

It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep.\nIt also may be that a relationship exists between retinal visual defects and cognitive visual dysfunction. PD patients have, indeed, deficits in performing orientation-dependent visual tasks.\nHowever, retinal neurons do not show orientation selectivity; these findings would suggest cortical defects. One possible reason may be that ascending dopamine deficiency may affect prefrontal circuits involved in the mnemonic coding of visual space. Another explanation would be that higher cortical structures are affected. These were indeed found to be the hippocampus (involved in short-term memory, which is the first type of memory to decline with age) and the brain amygdala, which influences autonomic and neurosecretory nuclei in the hypothalamus, and therefore the endocrine system. Neuroendocrine correlations, as was the previous one between melatonin and dopamine, would lead to completely novel physiological hypotheses.\nA young immunologist would seek the revival of the abandoned autoimmune theory and would note that in PD the glial cells start phagocytizing neurons and express the HLA-DR antigen which is absent in controls; glial cells may signal to the periphery since they also express receptors for interleukin 2 which is secreted presumably only by T-cells [37]. A pharmacologist would probably have the strongest arguments for a research proposal. Antipsychotic medication in the form of neuroleptics prescribed for schizophrenia and mania (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol) act by blocking the dopamine receptors and induce side effects as tardive dyskinesia, depigmentation of the SN neurons and skin sensitivity .

It consists of progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its onset was correlated with aging, toxic events, and metabolic causes. There is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance in Parkinson's disease, although a genetic component was incriminated in a small percentage of cases. There is strong evidence that it may be caused largely by oxidative stress and metal toxicity; patients have low levels of natural antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and high leve ls of iron in the substantia nigra and other areas of their brain, leading to the hypothesis that iron and other transition metals help catalyze the free radical reactions that destroy the dopaminergic neurons, and that high levels of antioxidants (e.g., uric acid, flavonoids, ubiquinone) may help prevent or slow down the progress of Parkinson's disease. This review paper is dedicated to analyzing this hypothesis and also attempts to define possible future directions of investigation.", "Introduction": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic illness due to the progressive degeneration of those neurons that normally produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to a dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. It is characterized by the following symptoms: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement) or akinesia (absence or difficulty in initiating movement), shuffling gait, and stooped posture; depression or dementia may also be present at later stages.\nThe most characteristic symptom, the accentuated tremor, led the British physician who first described this disease in 1817, James Parkinson, to name it \"shaking palsy\". Parkinson's disease is more common among men than among women and is four times more frequent in Caucasians than in darkly pigmented races. In the United States, PD affects about 1% of the population over age 60 [1]. Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed . Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause.

The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed [1]. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect. Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are also used. Avaiable surgical techniques are either ablative (thalamotomy and pallidotomy), augmentative (high-frequency deep-brain stimulation) or restaurative (gene therapy and neurotransplantation). Additiona l adjunctive therapies include physical therapy and nutritional counseling. However, the treatment is not curative; it can only relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease .

There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease [1]..\nThe remainder of this review paper is devoted to a brief anatomical background and to the analysis of the current hypothesis of the international research community stating that free radical toxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.", "Pathological anatomy": "The basal ganglia are a conglomeration of five distinguishable interconnected nuclei located at the base of the brain: the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum (consisting of caudate nucleus and putamen) and the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia became known as a component of the so-called extrapyramidal system, which is interconnected and cooperates with the pyramidal (corticospinal) system. The basal ganglia play an important role in voluntary movement and also have a role in cognitive function [2]..\nThe substantia nigra is a pigmented mass of neurons located in the midbrain (mesencephalon) between the cerebral peduncles and the tegmentum. It is composed of a dorsal pars compacta containing melanin pigment, a ventral pars reticulata containing iron compounds, and a pars lateralis. The dendrites of neurons in the pars compacta arborize in the pars reticulata. The neuronal population of the substantia nigra consists of pigmented and nonpigmented neurons. Pigmented neurons outnumber nonpigmented neurons two to one. The neurotransmitter in pigmented neurons is dopamine. Nonpigmented neurons are either cholinergic or GABAergic. There is a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in different disease states. Both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons are lost in patients with Huntington's chorea, another neurodegenerative disease of basal ganglia origin, which differs from PD in that it is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Only pigmented (dopaminergic) neurons are lost in PD. In idiopathic PD this loss occurs mostly in the center of the substantia nigra, while in the postencephalitic type of PD the pattern is uniform throughout the substantia nigra [2]. Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) . Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) [2]..\nIn postmortem studies it was discovered that the substantia nigra (meaning \"black substance\") had lost its pigment in PD patients. The pigment is called neuromelanin and was commented on as long ago as 1786 by Vicq d'Azyr. Apart from the substantia nigra, neuromelanin is also located in the locus coeruleus in the pons, where the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. It is certain, however, that neuromelanin is a recent phylogenetic development and it appears that the intensity of pigmentation is related to the degree of evolution of the brain.\nNeuromelanin is present only in the brain of humans, primates and some carnivores, e.g. the dog and the cat; it does not appear to be present in the brain of common laboratory animals, such as the rat, the guinea pig, and the rabbit. Evidence suggests that neuromelanin is not synthesized by a tyrosine-tyrosinase system as in skin melanocytes, but by a different pathway involving oxidation of brain catecholamines, in particular dopamine. Moreover, there is a striking similarity between the distribution of neuromelanin and that of the brain catecholaminesnorepinephrine and dopamine [3]. These anatomical findings inevitably led to the conclusion that melanin in neurons is intimately related to the ability of these cells to synthesize dopamine or norepinephrine. Indeed, neuromelanin may be looked upon as an indication of catecholamine synthesis in neuronal systems containing dopamine or norepinephrine. The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species .

A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species [3]..\nNeuromelanin has a strict anatomical localization and a late evolutionary appearance which suggest that it serves some positive function. Melanin deposition may provide a mechanism of inactivation of some metabolic product possibly of catecholamine origin which cannot be removed from neurons by other means. Alternatively, the chemical constituents of melanin, in particular the heavy metals it contains -zinc, copper, iron, manganese, titanium, cobalt, and nickel -may influence neuronal metabolism. A significant feature of neuromelanin is the presence of free semiquinone radicals, which might influence oxidation-reduction reactions [3]..\nParkinson's disease affects the cytoskeleton and damage occurs only in selectively vulnerable neurons. As a result of the cytoskeletal changes, the so-called Le wy bodies may appear; their major components are abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments, in other words altered \"building blocks\" of the cytoskeleton. The Lewy bodies are concentric hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions seen in pigmented nigral cells, but not in all cases of PD (e.g., not in those cases following encephalitis letargica) [3]..", "Physiopathology": "Parkinsonism may occur following carbon monoxide poisoning or cranial trauma ( e.g. dementia pugilistica, a condition seen in professional boxers such as Muhammad Ali).\nParkinson's disease may also develop later in life, in connection with a neurotoxic event that occurred at an early age, e.g. encephalitis lethargica or a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic infection. Certain diuretics (e.g. reserpine), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (e.g. naproxen), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) and \"designer drugs\" (e.g. MPTP) have all been implicated in causing or exacerbating PD. Environmental and dietary factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, i.e. occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides, the high intake of animal fats, the high intake of sugars (mono-and disaccharides), the high aluminum content of drinking water, the mercury from dental amalgams, the presence of other metals, notably manganese, cadmium and copper, as well as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. multiple lacunar strokes) [4]..\nA consensus is now emerging that major causes of neurodegenerative diseases in general, and PD in particular, are oxidative stress (i.e., an excess of free radicals) and metal toxicity [5]..\nThe following section of this paper is devoted to the critical review of this hypothesis. In relation to this hypothesis, one of the above-mentioned causative factors, MPTP, is entitled to a special discussion. MPTP-induced parkinsonism is a model for PD in human and non-human primates and was discovered accidentally. In 1982, several heroin addicts in California and Maryland suddenly developed acute and permanent parkinsonism after injecting a synthetic opiate containing the impurity MPTP. The symptoms required constant levodopa treatment ever since. MPTP is converted by the neuronal enzyme MAO-B into its toxic metabolite MPP + which has structural similarities to dopamine and is taken up into the dopaminergic nerve terminal by the dopamine uptake system where it causes cell damage. Another drug, selegiline (or deprenyl), an almost forgotten substance that was invented by a Hungarian scientist and failed its purpose as an antidepressant, was found to have antagonist actions to MPTP since it is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, preventing dopamine depletion and PD symptoms [6]. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.", "Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease": "One of the leading hypotheses nowadays is that oxidative stress by ROS damages essential components of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, including DNA, protein structures and the cell membrane, resulting in functional disruption and ultimate cell death. These free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism, but specific cellular detoxification systems normally minimize their damaging effects [7]. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:\n1) increased membrane peroxidation in the SNc and widespread ROS-induced protein modification, with protein carbonyl levels elevated in all regions of the brain [7,8];;\n2) elevated TBA-reactive substance levels (a measure of the secondary products of lipid peroxidation) accompanied by decreased PUFA levels (the peroxidation substrate) [8];;\n3) increased 8-hydroxy-2\u2032deoxyguanosine levels in the SNc and other brain regions, indicative of ROS-mediated DNA damage [7,9]. Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage . Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage [10]..\nThere are several potential metabolic sources of increased oxidative stress in PD: dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free iron levels, accumulation of AGEs, reduced activity of free radical defense systems, and the deleterious role of glial cells. Several toxins may also be implicated in PD. A brief discussion is devoted to each of these hypotheses.", "1) Dopamine metabolism": "Dopamine is oxidized in the brain via two pathways. a) Auto-oxidation of dopamine leads to the production of toxic semiquinone species (SQ \u2022 ), which via a metabolic cascade can be polymerized to neuromelanin. Little can be said with certainty about the effect of neuromelanin on neuronal function. It is generally regarded as a waste product of dopamine auto-oxidation and as a \"double-edged sword\" with respect to free radical reactions, in that it sequesters redox-active metal ions (such as iron), but may also promote ROS-generating processes and may also represent a depot for other cellular toxins, such as MPP + [11]. b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is: . b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is:\nAlso, MAO-B, but not MAO-A, is found at an increased level (approximately 25% higher) in the SN of PD patients; MAO-B in blood platelets is significantly higher in PD and Alzheimer's disease [6]. This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A . This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A [6]. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.", "2) Mitochondrial dysfunction": "Evidence implying that mitochondria have a crucial role in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is accumulating rapidly. Both these conditions are distinctive forms of cell death, as defined morphologically; however, in neuronal populations and diseases such as PD they can either coexist or be sequential events. Fig. 1 (from  (from [12]) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. ) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death.

It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration [7]..\nThe CNS has a particularly high energy requirement, thus making it very susceptible to  One of the known substrates of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD consists of abnormalities of the respiratory chain (schematically drawn in Fig. 2, from , from [13]). The respiratory chain consists of five complexes aligned along the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The functions of the respiratory chain are proton pumping, electron transport, conversion of atomic oxygen into water, and, most importantly, production of energy in the form of ATP. In total, the five enzyme complexes are formed by more than 80 subunits; 13 of these are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the others by nuclear DNA. In MPTP-induced parkinsonism, MPTP is metabolized to MPP + which is preferentially stored in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, where it inhibits complex I of the electron-transport chain, leading to reductions in ATP production and elevated ROS generation, which in turn result in oxidative damage to various cell structures ).

Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD . Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [12]. In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN . In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN [12,14] and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically  and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically [15]. Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering .

Absolute iron levels are increased in PD by about 35%, specifically in the SNc [18]..\nOf particular significance in PD is the shift in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio from almost 2:1 to 1:2 [18], consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction , consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction [10]::\nThe reduction of Fe(III) by the superoxide radical would increase the rate of the Fenton reaction, thus driving the Haber-Weiss cycle-mediated production of \u2022 OH (4) [7]::\nThe availability of soluble iron complexes for participation in this reaction is a major determinant of the toxicity of ROS in the neuron. Iron participates in free radical-generating reactions only in the free, ferrous form. Ferric iron in the SNc is normally bound either by ferritin (about 90%) or by neuromelanin (10%). A variety of molecules with an o-dihydroxyphenyl structure (including 6-OHDA and dopamine) effectively release ferritin-bound iron in vitro and thereby stimulate lipid peroxidation [7,19]; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine ; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine [20]..\nIn animal models, infusion of iron into the SNc induced neurodegeneration and a dose-related decline in striatal dopamine. In PD, it is not known whether the increased iron levels are due to reduced ferritin levels or increased cellular uptake of iron. It is considered unlikely that iron is involved early in the pathogenesis of PD, since laboratory tests have not indicated elevated levels of iron in the preclinical stage of the disease, however, its potent ability to generate ROS means that it may play a significant role in the progression of PD [7], especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels , especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels [21] which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts  which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts [21]..\nIn correlation with the chemistry of iron, it was shown that the enzyme SOD may be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence comes from studies demonstrating that the inactivation of the mouse gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase leads to tissue-specific inhibition of the respiratory chain enzymes complex I and complex II, inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase and accumulation of DNA oxidative damage [22]. Complex II contains three Fe-S clusters, only one of which is tetranuclear (4Fe-4S) cluster. The inactivation of aconitase in SOD-deficient mice is likely to be caused by oxidation of its Fe-S cluster by superoxide, which liberates the iron as Fe 2+ ; this iron can then participate in the Fenton reaction, generating hydroxyl radical and leading to further oxidative damage .

Their accumulation in the ageing human brain is facilitated by oxidative stress and transition metals, including iron, and their formation is inhibited by radical scavengers and thiol antioxidants. Highly reactive dicarbonyl products and ROS are produced in the course of AGE synthesis, thus further enhancing oxidative stress.

In the normal brain, nigral GSH levels are low in comparison with other brain regions [25]. In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN. Of the other enzymes which modulate GSH levels, only the levels of ?-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is associated with GSH translocation and degradation, are significantly different (doubled).

Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.", "The deleterious actions of glial cells": "The debate focusing on the role of glial cells in PD is very interesting. Until recently, it was assumed that glial cells have a protective role, since glial cell distribution is not uniform across the brainstem: it is lowest in the areas that are prone to PD and highest in the areas where dopaminergic neurons are preserved [27]. The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx . The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx [27]..\nHowever, it was suggested recently that glial cells may damage dopaminergic neurons by secreting factors that might diffuse into neurons or act on membrane receptors. The density of glial cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, interferon ? and interleukine 1\u00df is increased in the SN in PD [28]. Cytokines were found to induce the expression of CD23, a low-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor which, following appropriate ligation, induces the expression of the enzyme NOS II that produces nitric oxide which is diffusible and may penetrate into neurons, combine with superoxide radicals and form peroxinitrates that are extremely toxic; indeed, the concentration of nitrites is increased in the CSF of PD patients .

The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.. The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.\nThe mean TNF-a level was 2.6-fold higher in CSF specimens from PD patients than in those of controls. It was shown that CSF specimens obtained by lombar puncture from these patients were cytotoxic to dopaminergic neurons in primary mesencephalic cell culture. Specimens of CSF were evaluated in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell lines for cytotoxicity by viability assay and by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. Cytotoxicity was assessed by cell structure and cell viability staining. To explore the possible involvement of apoptotic mechanisms in CSF-induced cell injury, these cells were also stained for DNA fragmentation with the TUNEL technique. A typical pattern that included nuclear chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation was apparent after incubation with CSF, suggesting the role of apoptotic mechanisms. Along with TNF-a, interleukin 1\u00df was also elevated in CSF in PD [31]..\nA summary of the potential deleterious or neuroprotective actions of glial cells is shown in Figure 3 (from  (from [27]):):\nFig. 3.

OH and H 2 O 2 , and thus possibly to oxidative stress, stimulated the search for a \"natural\" inhibitor that might represent the causative agent in PD [7]. The possibility that an external toxin is involved was suggerated by epidemiological studies which found a greater risk for PD associated with exposure to any of a range of seemingly unrelated variables: agricultural chemicals, industrial environments, different metals.

It is more likely that, starting from the existing accomplishments of the contemporary research scene, several main directions of future investigation will emerge.\nA scientist true to the classical conception of the anatomical school would indeed choose to pursue the hard facts: that only pigmented neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease, and will focus on neuromelanin as an indication of catecholamine synthesis or a side-product of dopamine auto-oxidation in neurons. The properties of neuromelanin will certainly have to be investigated in detail, since its chemical identity with oculocutaneous melanin has never been established. Valuable starting points are the facts that: 1) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is localized in neurons and not in melanocytes; 2) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is present (spared) in the genetic disease albinism -an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase; 3) the skin pigment seems to be a protective factor in some races against neurodegeneration, a cutaneous barrier that would bind toxins as neuromelanin binds MPP + ; 4) primary malignant mela nomas of the CNS are not recorded; 4) neuromelanin binds and accumulates heavy metals. Regarding the comparison with skin melanin, it is significant that pigmented cells called melanophores in heterothermic vertebrates (e.g. amphibians) possess dopamine receptors that mediate melanosome aggregation and melonosome dispersion, and also receptors for norepinephrine [33]. Thus the ligand-receptor type of interaction between dopamine and melanin could be further explored at epithelial and neural level; on the basis of dose-response curves, a characterization of these receptors could be attempted as a function of agonist affinity; the goal of such a research project would be the identification of several classes of receptors based on differences in their expression. The histochemical and spectroscopic properties of neuromelanin will have to be studied in detail, since the anatomical distribution, the biochemical pathways and the selective vulnerability to various diseases do not argue in favor of their chemical identity. A logical starting point would be the examination of the spatial structures of these biopolymers generally called melanins by Xray diffraction techniques in a synchrotron radiation facility, by following changes in diffraction data during polymerization or depolymerization of melanins. This may help understanding the structural changes at different levels of organization in melanins. Also, since neuromelanin contains small amounts of metals, the immediate chemical environment of the heavy atom in the melanin structure and the location of the binding sites may also be worth investigating, and the most appropriate technique would probably be EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure). The principle of EXAFS is that when X-rays traverse a sample under study, the transmitted beam suffers an attenuation which normally changes monotonically; if the sample contains a heavy atom, the attenuation increase steeply. Conventional techniques as Perls staining and transmission electron microscopy have failed to properly serve the purposes of identifying neuromelanin granules in brain slices, but a promising technique is LAMMA (laser microprobe mass analyzer), an advanced type of mass spectrophotometer; the recording of peaks corresponds to increased quantities of iron and aluminum that may exist in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it is important to note that neuromelanin is believed to coexist in granules with lipofuscin, and that the nature of their association is at present very poorly understood; a starting point for future directions of research would be the model system in which bleaching with hydrogen peroxide gradually converts the optical and histochemical properties of melanin to those of lipofuscin and the reverse, in which lipofuscin, experimentally melanized with catecholamines, acquires characteristic optical properties of neuromelanin .

Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.. Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.\nFrom the point of view of the physiologist, however, the most important issue would be function, and not structure. Recent studies have expanded the abnormalities of dopaminergic neurons well beyond the limits of the substantia nigra, and have challenged the conservative view that this is exclusively a motor system disorder. In PD, abnormal visually evoked potentials led to the conclusion that visual dysfunction is a result of dopaminergic deficiency in both humans and animals [35]. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.\nLight stimulates retinal tyrosine hydroxylase leading to the release of dopamine. Dopamine has a role in visual adaptation and in the center-surround organization of retinal receptive fields in various mammalian species. Obviously, neurophysiological techniques using intracellular recordings would be the best method of pursuing the issue of the broader functions of dopaminergic neurons affected in PD.\nThere is also evidence of an endogenous retinal clock regulating photoreceptor sensitivity [36]. Recent data suggest circadian control of contrast sensitivity via dopaminergic mechanisms in PD. How and where the circadian regulator interacts with endogenous relase and uptake of dopamine in the visual pathway is not known. As a physiology student, the author of this paper would attempt to suggest a correlation between the role of melatonin as a regulator of the circadian rhythm and this retinal clock, as endogenous melatonin levels decline with age and its role may be partly overtaken, in order to maintain the usual sleep-wakefulness cycle, by other systems in the body, notably the dopaminergic system of neural transmission; when suffering of PD, this might affect elderly individuals. It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep..

PD patients have, indeed, deficits in performing orientation-dependent visual tasks.\nHowever, retinal neurons do not show orientation selectivity; these findings would suggest cortical defects. One possible reason may be that ascending dopamine deficiency may affect prefrontal circuits involved in the mnemonic coding of visual space. Another explanation would be that higher cortical structures are affected. These were indeed found to be the hippocampus (involved in short-term memory, which is the first type of memory to decline with age) and the brain amygdala, which influences autonomic and neurosecretory nuclei in the hypothalamus, and therefore the endocrine system. Neuroendocrine correlations, as was the previous one between melatonin and dopamine, would lead to completely novel physiological hypotheses.\nA young immunologist would seek the revival of the abandoned autoimmune theory and would note that in PD the glial cells start phagocytizing neurons and express the HLA-DR antigen which is absent in controls; glial cells may signal to the periphery since they also express receptors for interleukin 2 which is secreted presumably only by T-cells [37]. A pharmacologist would probably have the strongest arguments for a research proposal.

Abstract]\nParkinson's disease is a chronic illness classified within the category of neurodegenative diseases along with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia and others. It consists of progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its onset was correlated with aging, toxic events, and metabolic causes. There is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance in Parkinson's disease, although a genetic component was incriminated in a small percentage of cases. There is strong evidence that it may be caused largely by oxidative stress and metal toxicity; patients have low levels of natural antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and high leve ls of iron in the substantia nigra and other areas of their brain, leading to the hypothesis that iron and other transition metals help catalyze the free radical reactions that destroy the dopaminergic neurons, and that high levels of antioxidants (e.g., uric acid, flavonoids, ubiquinone) may help prevent or slow down the progress of Parkinson's disease. This review paper is dedicated to analyzing this hypothesis and also attempts to define possible future directions of investigation.\n\n[2. Introduction]\nParkinson's disease is a chronic illness due to the progressive degeneration of those neurons that normally produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to a dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. It is characterized by the following symptoms: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement) or akinesia (absence or difficulty in initiating movement), shuffling gait, and stooped posture; depression or dementia may also be present at later stages.\nThe most characteristic symptom, the accentuated tremor, led the British physician who first described this disease in 1817, James Parkinson, to name it \"shaking palsy\". Parkinson's disease is more common among men than among women and is four times more frequent in Caucasians than in darkly pigmented races. In the United States, PD affects about 1% of the population over age 60 [1]. Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed . Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed [1]. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect. Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are also used. Avaiable surgical techniques are either ablative (thalamotomy and pallidotomy), augmentative (high-frequency deep-brain stimulation) or restaurative (gene therapy and neurotransplantation). Additiona l adjunctive therapies include physical therapy and nutritional counseling. However, the treatment is not curative; it can only relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease . Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect.

There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease [1]..\nThe remainder of this review paper is devoted to a brief anatomical background and to the analysis of the current hypothesis of the international research community stating that free radical toxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.\n\n[3. Pathological anatomy]\nThe basal ganglia are a conglomeration of five distinguishable interconnected nuclei located at the base of the brain: the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum (consisting of caudate nucleus and putamen) and the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia became known as a component of the so-called extrapyramidal system, which is interconnected and cooperates with the pyramidal (corticospinal) system. The basal ganglia play an important role in voluntary movement and also have a role in cognitive function [2]..\nThe substantia nigra is a pigmented mass of neurons located in the midbrain (mesencephalon) between the cerebral peduncles and the tegmentum. It is composed of a dorsal pars compacta containing melanin pigment, a ventral pars reticulata containing iron compounds, and a pars lateralis. The dendrites of neurons in the pars compacta arborize in the pars reticulata. The neuronal population of the substantia nigra consists of pigmented and nonpigmented neurons. Pigmented neurons outnumber nonpigmented neurons two to one. The neurotransmitter in pigmented neurons is dopamine. Nonpigmented neurons are either cholinergic or GABAergic. There is a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in different disease states. Both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons are lost in patients with Huntington's chorea, another neurodegenerative disease of basal ganglia origin, which differs from PD in that it is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Only pigmented (dopaminergic) neurons are lost in PD. In idiopathic PD this loss occurs mostly in the center of the substantia nigra, while in the postencephalitic type of PD the pattern is uniform throughout the substantia nigra [2]. Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) . Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) [2]..\nIn postmortem studies it was discovered that the substantia nigra (meaning \"black substance\") had lost its pigment in PD patients. The pigment is called neuromelanin and was commented on as long ago as 1786 by Vicq d'Azyr. Apart from the substantia nigra, neuromelanin is also located in the locus coeruleus in the pons, where the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. It is certain, however, that neuromelanin is a recent phylogenetic development and it appears that the intensity of pigmentation is related to the degree of evolution of the brain.\nNeuromelanin is present only in the brain of humans, primates and some carnivores, e.g. the dog and the cat; it does not appear to be present in the brain of common laboratory animals, such as the rat, the guinea pig, and the rabbit. Evidence suggests that neuromelanin is not synthesized by a tyrosine-tyrosinase system as in skin melanocytes, but by a different pathway involving oxidation of brain catecholamines, in particular dopamine. Moreover, there is a striking similarity between the distribution of neuromelanin and that of the brain catecholaminesnorepinephrine and dopamine [3]. These anatomical findings inevitably led to the conclusion that melanin in neurons is intimately related to the ability of these cells to synthesize dopamine or norepinephrine. Indeed, neuromelanin may be looked upon as an indication of catecholamine synthesis in neuronal systems containing dopamine or norepinephrine. The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species .

A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species [3]..\nNeuromelanin has a strict anatomical localization and a late evolutionary appearance which suggest that it serves some positive function. Melanin deposition may provide a mechanism of inactivation of some metabolic product possibly of catecholamine origin which cannot be removed from neurons by other means. Alternatively, the chemical constituents of melanin, in particular the heavy metals it contains -zinc, copper, iron, manganese, titanium, cobalt, and nickel -may influence neuronal metabolism. A significant feature of neuromelanin is the presence of free semiquinone radicals, which might influence oxidation-reduction reactions [3]..\nParkinson's disease affects the cytoskeleton and damage occurs only in selectively vulnerable neurons. As a result of the cytoskeletal changes, the so-called Le wy bodies may appear; their major components are abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments, in other words altered \"building blocks\" of the cytoskeleton. The Lewy bodies are concentric hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions seen in pigmented nigral cells, but not in all cases of PD (e.g., not in those cases following encephalitis letargica) [3]..\n\n[4. Physiopathology]\nParkinsonism may occur following carbon monoxide poisoning or cranial trauma ( e.g. dementia pugilistica, a condition seen in professional boxers such as Muhammad Ali).\nParkinson's disease may also develop later in life, in connection with a neurotoxic event that occurred at an early age, e.g. encephalitis lethargica or a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic infection. Certain diuretics (e.g. reserpine), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (e.g. naproxen), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) and \"designer drugs\" (e.g. MPTP) have all been implicated in causing or exacerbating PD. Environmental and dietary factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, i.e. occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides, the high intake of animal fats, the high intake of sugars (mono-and disaccharides), the high aluminum content of drinking water, the mercury from dental amalgams, the presence of other metals, notably manganese, cadmium and copper, as well as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. multiple lacunar strokes) [4]..\nA consensus is now emerging that major causes of neurodegenerative diseases in general, and PD in particular, are oxidative stress (i.e., an excess of free radicals) and metal toxicity [5]..\nThe following section of this paper is devoted to the critical review of this hypothesis. In relation to this hypothesis, one of the above-mentioned causative factors, MPTP, is entitled to a special discussion. MPTP-induced parkinsonism is a model for PD in human and non-human primates and was discovered accidentally. In 1982, several heroin addicts in California and Maryland suddenly developed acute and permanent parkinsonism after injecting a synthetic opiate containing the impurity MPTP. The symptoms required constant levodopa treatment ever since. MPTP is converted by the neuronal enzyme MAO-B into its toxic metabolite MPP + which has structural similarities to dopamine and is taken up into the dopaminergic nerve terminal by the dopamine uptake system where it causes cell damage. Another drug, selegiline (or deprenyl), an almost forgotten substance that was invented by a Hungarian scientist and failed its purpose as an antidepressant, was found to have antagonist actions to MPTP since it is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, preventing dopamine depletion and PD symptoms [6]. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.\n\n[5. Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease]\nOne of the leading hypotheses nowadays is that oxidative stress by ROS damages essential components of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, including DNA, protein structures and the cell membrane, resulting in functional disruption and ultimate cell death. These free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism, but specific cellular detoxification systems normally minimize their damaging effects [7]. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:\n1) increased membrane peroxidation in the SNc and widespread ROS-induced protein modification, with protein carbonyl levels elevated in all regions of the brain [7,8];;\n2) elevated TBA-reactive substance levels (a measure of the secondary products of lipid peroxidation) accompanied by decreased PUFA levels (the peroxidation substrate) [8];;\n3) increased 8-hydroxy-2\u2032deoxyguanosine levels in the SNc and other brain regions, indicative of ROS-mediated DNA damage [7,9]. Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage . Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage [10]..\nThere are several potential metabolic sources of increased oxidative stress in PD: dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free iron levels, accumulation of AGEs, reduced activity of free radical defense systems, and the deleterious role of glial cells. Several toxins may also be implicated in PD. A brief discussion is devoted to each of these hypotheses.\n\n[6. 1) Dopamine metabolism]\nDopamine is oxidized in the brain via two pathways. a) Auto-oxidation of dopamine leads to the production of toxic semiquinone species (SQ \u2022 ), which via a metabolic cascade can be polymerized to neuromelanin. Little can be said with certainty about the effect of neuromelanin on neuronal function. It is generally regarded as a waste product of dopamine auto-oxidation and as a \"double-edged sword\" with respect to free radical reactions, in that it sequesters redox-active metal ions (such as iron), but may also promote ROS-generating processes and may also represent a depot for other cellular toxins, such as MPP + [11]. b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is: . b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is:\nAlso, MAO-B, but not MAO-A, is found at an increased level (approximately 25% higher) in the SN of PD patients; MAO-B in blood platelets is significantly higher in PD and Alzheimer's disease [6]. This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A . This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A [6]. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B.\n\n[7. 2) Mitochondrial dysfunction]\nEvidence implying that mitochondria have a crucial role in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is accumulating rapidly. Both these conditions are distinctive forms of cell death, as defined morphologically; however, in neuronal populations and diseases such as PD they can either coexist or be sequential events. Fig. 1 (from  (from [12]) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. ) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. 1a depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig.  depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig. 1b depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation). The nature of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is still undetermined, but there are indications that it involves a combination of apoptotic processes and necrotic degeneration. It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration  depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation). The nature of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is still undetermined, but there are indications that it involves a combination of apoptotic processes and necrotic degeneration. It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration [7]..\nThe CNS has a particularly high energy requirement, thus making it very susceptible to  One of the known substrates of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD consists of abnormalities of the respiratory chain (schematically drawn in Fig. 2, from , from [13]). The respiratory chain consists of five complexes aligned along the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The functions of the respiratory chain are proton pumping, electron transport, conversion of atomic oxygen into water, and, most importantly, production of energy in the form of ATP. In total, the five enzyme complexes are formed by more than 80 subunits; 13 of these are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the others by nuclear DNA. In MPTP-induced parkinsonism, MPTP is metabolized to MPP + which is preferentially stored in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, where it inhibits complex I of the electron-transport chain, leading to reductions in ATP production and elevated ROS generation, which in turn result in oxidative damage to various cell structures ).

Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD . Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [12]. In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN . In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN [12,14] and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically  and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically [15]. Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering .

These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering [12,16]. It is now generally accepted that PD patients present a complex I defect in their substantia nigra. Some authors have argued that in PD complex I defic iency is systemic, after having had detected this feature in several peripheric tissues, including platelets, thus offering the interesting possibility of a convenient biomarker for PD .

Increased free iron levels]\nThe normal basal ganglia are rich in iron, with highest levels in the SN, globus pallidus and putamen. Absolute iron levels are increased in PD by about 35%, specifically in the SNc [18]..\nOf particular significance in PD is the shift in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio from almost 2:1 to 1:2 [18], consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction , consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction [10]::\nThe reduction of Fe(III) by the superoxide radical would increase the rate of the Fenton reaction, thus driving the Haber-Weiss cycle-mediated production of \u2022 OH (4) [7]::\nThe availability of soluble iron complexes for participation in this reaction is a major determinant of the toxicity of ROS in the neuron. Iron participates in free radical-generating reactions only in the free, ferrous form. Ferric iron in the SNc is normally bound either by ferritin (about 90%) or by neuromelanin (10%). A variety of molecules with an o-dihydroxyphenyl structure (including 6-OHDA and dopamine) effectively release ferritin-bound iron in vitro and thereby stimulate lipid peroxidation [7,19]; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine ; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine [20]..\nIn animal models, infusion of iron into the SNc induced neurodegeneration and a dose-related decline in striatal dopamine. In PD, it is not known whether the increased iron levels are due to reduced ferritin levels or increased cellular uptake of iron. It is considered unlikely that iron is involved early in the pathogenesis of PD, since laboratory tests have not indicated elevated levels of iron in the preclinical stage of the disease, however, its potent ability to generate ROS means that it may play a significant role in the progression of PD [7], especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels , especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels [21] which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts  which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts [21]..\nIn correlation with the chemistry of iron, it was shown that the enzyme SOD may be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence comes from studies demonstrating that the inactivation of the mouse gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase leads to tissue-specific inhibition of the respiratory chain enzymes complex I and complex II, inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase and accumulation of DNA oxidative damage [22]. Complex II contains three Fe-S clusters, only one of which is tetranuclear (4Fe-4S) cluster. The inactivation of aconitase in SOD-deficient mice is likely to be caused by oxidation of its Fe-S cluster by superoxide, which liberates the iron as Fe 2+ ; this iron can then participate in the Fenton reaction, generating hydroxyl radical and leading to further oxidative damage .

Accumulation of AGEs]\nAdvanced glycation end-products are a group of substances formed by a cascade of reaction that follow the reaction of protein amino groups (especially the N-terminal and side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine) with monosaccharide molecules [23]. Their accumulation in the ageing human brain is facilitated by oxidative stress and transition metals, including iron, and their formation is inhibited by radical scavengers and thiol antioxidants. Highly reactive dicarbonyl products and ROS are produced in the course of AGE synthesis, thus further enhancing oxidative stress. Due to these properties and their promotion of protein cross-linking, AGEs have been implicated in degenerative disorders associated with ageing in the periphery as well as in the CNS .

Due to these properties and their promotion of protein cross-linking, AGEs have been implicated in degenerative disorders associated with ageing in the periphery as well as in the CNS [7]. In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques . In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques [24], and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation , and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation [24]. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.\nHeme-oxygenase-1 immunoreactivity was localized to the filaments of Lewy bodies, suggesting a particular sensitivity of the cytoskeleton [24]..\n\n[10. Reduced activity of free radical defense systems]\nThe cellular radical detoxification system (its most important components being SOD and GPx) is supposed to neutralize free radicals by catalyzing reactions ( 5) and ( ) and ( 6), respectively:), respectively:\nHowever, the activity of this system declines, even with normal aging, and, even in normal individuals, the neurons in the SNc are particularly vulnerable enzymatically. In the normal brain, nigral GSH levels are low in comparison with other brain regions [25]. In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN. Of the other enzymes which modulate GSH levels, only the levels of ?-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is associated with GSH translocation and degradation, are significantly different (doubled). This change is restricted to PD and the SNc . In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN. Of the other enzymes which modulate GSH levels, only the levels of ?-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is associated with GSH translocation and degradation, are significantly different (doubled). This change is restricted to PD and the SNc [25]. It seems that the decline in GSH levels occurs early in the course of the disorder, and hence the view that GSH depletion represents a \"first blow\" that renders the cell vulnerable to neurodegeneration possibly induced by other factors . It seems that the decline in GSH levels occurs early in the course of the disorder, and hence the view that GSH depletion represents a \"first blow\" that renders the cell vulnerable to neurodegeneration possibly induced by other factors [25]..\nMelatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland (epiphysis) and involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm, was recently reported to have antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties in animal and cell culture models: free radical scavenging, up-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes (including SOD and GPx) and inhibition of NOS [26]. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.\n\n[11. The deleterious actions of glial cells]\nThe debate focusing on the role of glial cells in PD is very interesting. Until recently, it was assumed that glial cells have a protective role, since glial cell distribution is not uniform across the brainstem: it is lowest in the areas that are prone to PD and highest in the areas where dopaminergic neurons are preserved [27]. The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx . The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx [27]..\nHowever, it was suggested recently that glial cells may damage dopaminergic neurons by secreting factors that might diffuse into neurons or act on membrane receptors. The density of glial cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, interferon ? and interleukine 1\u00df is increased in the SN in PD [28]. Cytokines were found to induce the expression of CD23, a low-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor which, following appropriate ligation, induces the expression of the enzyme NOS II that produces nitric oxide which is diffusible and may penetrate into neurons, combine with superoxide radicals and form peroxinitrates that are extremely toxic; indeed, the concentration of nitrites is increased in the CSF of PD patients .

The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.. The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.\nThe mean TNF-a level was 2.6-fold higher in CSF specimens from PD patients than in those of controls. It was shown that CSF specimens obtained by lombar puncture from these patients were cytotoxic to dopaminergic neurons in primary mesencephalic cell culture. Specimens of CSF were evaluated in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell lines for cytotoxicity by viability assay and by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. Cytotoxicity was assessed by cell structure and cell viability staining. To explore the possible involvement of apoptotic mechanisms in CSF-induced cell injury, these cells were also stained for DNA fragmentation with the TUNEL technique. A typical pattern that included nuclear chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation was apparent after incubation with CSF, suggesting the role of apoptotic mechanisms. Along with TNF-a, interleukin 1\u00df was also elevated in CSF in PD [31]..\nA summary of the potential deleterious or neuroprotective actions of glial cells is shown in Figure 3 (from  (from [27]):):\nFig. 3. The potential deleterious and neuroprotective effects of glial cells. The potential deleterious and neuroprotective effects of glial cells\n\n[12. 7) The generation of free radicals by toxins in PD]\nThe recognition that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by MPP + (and also by paraquat and 6-OHDA) not only leads to energy deficits but also the generation of O 2 ? -, ? OH and H 2 O 2 , and thus possibly to oxidative stress, stimulated the search for a \"natural\" inhibitor that might represent the causative agent in PD [7]. The possibility that an external toxin is involved was suggerated by epidemiological studies which found a greater risk for PD associated with exposure to any of a range of seemingly unrelated variables: agricultural chemicals, industrial environments, different metals. The development of multifactorial or interaction models may allow the detection of at-risk individuals without first identifying a specific toxin .

The development of multifactorial or interaction models may allow the detection of at-risk individuals without first identifying a specific toxin [7]..\nA summary of the cellular mechanisms which may be involved in the neurodegenerative process in PD is shown in Figure 4 (from  (from [7]) in an attempt to develop such an interaction model, taking into consideration the dynamics of all the factors shown above: challenge to engage in this research field, considering that there is, in fact, no known treatment able to halt or reverse the process of degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The hope for a cure is still alive, and a cure will be eventually found; however, it is remarkable that, with practically no clinical approach left untried, the best is yet to come in Parkinson's disease therapy. As far as we know, neurodegeneration-whether slower or faster-is irreversible. Every single method that has been tried until now has its own limitations, and none is universal. Responsiveness to levodopa decreases gradually; immunotherapy has failed; graft survival in neurotransplantation is variable and restricted by the number of human fetal donors avaiable; xenotransplantation is subject to acute vascular rejection after a few days; thalamotomy abolishes tremor only unilaterally; gene therapy is by no means performed on a large scale, and in none of the above was a full recovery ever recorded. The answer is probably to be found in the title of another article, that of M. Piccolino: Old Cells, Old Experiments, New Results. The critical assimilation of the literature does not lead to the belief that the cure for Parkinson's disease will consist in a \"magic bullet\", as penicillin was for tuberculosis in the the time of Alexander Fleming.

The properties of neuromelanin will certainly have to be investigated in detail, since its chemical identity with oculocutaneous melanin has never been established. Valuable starting points are the facts that: 1) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is localized in neurons and not in melanocytes; 2) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is present (spared) in the genetic disease albinism -an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase; 3) the skin pigment seems to be a protective factor in some races against neurodegeneration, a cutaneous barrier that would bind toxins as neuromelanin binds MPP + ; 4) primary malignant mela nomas of the CNS are not recorded; 4) neuromelanin binds and accumulates heavy metals. Regarding the comparison with skin melanin, it is significant that pigmented cells called melanophores in heterothermic vertebrates (e.g. amphibians) possess dopamine receptors that mediate melanosome aggregation and melonosome dispersion, and also receptors for norepinephrine [33]. Thus the ligand-receptor type of interaction between dopamine and melanin could be further explored at epithelial and neural level; on the basis of dose-response curves, a characterization of these receptors could be attempted as a function of agonist affinity; the goal of such a research project would be the identification of several classes of receptors based on differences in their expression. The histochemical and spectroscopic properties of neuromelanin will have to be studied in detail, since the anatomical distribution, the biochemical pathways and the selective vulnerability to various diseases do not argue in favor of their chemical identity. A logical starting point would be the examination of the spatial structures of these biopolymers generally called melanins by Xray diffraction techniques in a synchrotron radiation facility, by following changes in diffraction data during polymerization or depolymerization of melanins. This may help understanding the structural changes at different levels of organization in melanins. Also, since neuromelanin contains small amounts of metals, the immediate chemical environment of the heavy atom in the melanin structure and the location of the binding sites may also be worth investigating, and the most appropriate technique would probably be EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure). The principle of EXAFS is that when X-rays traverse a sample under study, the transmitted beam suffers an attenuation which normally changes monotonically; if the sample contains a heavy atom, the attenuation increase steeply. Conventional techniques as Perls staining and transmission electron microscopy have failed to properly serve the purposes of identifying neuromelanin granules in brain slices, but a promising technique is LAMMA (laser microprobe mass analyzer), an advanced type of mass spectrophotometer; the recording of peaks corresponds to increased quantities of iron and aluminum that may exist in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it is important to note that neuromelanin is believed to coexist in granules with lipofuscin, and that the nature of their association is at present very poorly understood; a starting point for future directions of research would be the model system in which bleaching with hydrogen peroxide gradually converts the optical and histochemical properties of melanin to those of lipofuscin and the reverse, in which lipofuscin, experimentally melanized with catecholamines, acquires characteristic optical properties of neuromelanin .

Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.\nFrom the point of view of the physiologist, however, the most important issue would be function, and not structure. Recent studies have expanded the abnormalities of dopaminergic neurons well beyond the limits of the substantia nigra, and have challenged the conservative view that this is exclusively a motor system disorder. In PD, abnormal visually evoked potentials led to the conclusion that visual dysfunction is a result of dopaminergic deficiency in both humans and animals [35]. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.\nLight stimulates retinal tyrosine hydroxylase leading to the release of dopamine. Dopamine has a role in visual adaptation and in the center-surround organization of retinal receptive fields in various mammalian species. Obviously, neurophysiological techniques using intracellular recordings would be the best method of pursuing the issue of the broader functions of dopaminergic neurons affected in PD.\nThere is also evidence of an endogenous retinal clock regulating photoreceptor sensitivity [36]. Recent data suggest circadian control of contrast sensitivity via dopaminergic mechanisms in PD. How and where the circadian regulator interacts with endogenous relase and uptake of dopamine in the visual pathway is not known. As a physiology student, the author of this paper would attempt to suggest a correlation between the role of melatonin as a regulator of the circadian rhythm and this retinal clock, as endogenous melatonin levels decline with age and its role may be partly overtaken, in order to maintain the usual sleep-wakefulness cycle, by other systems in the body, notably the dopaminergic system of neural transmission; when suffering of PD, this might affect elderly individuals. It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep..

It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep.\nIt also may be that a relationship exists between retinal visual defects and cognitive visual dysfunction. PD patients have, indeed, deficits in performing orientation-dependent visual tasks.\nHowever, retinal neurons do not show orientation selectivity; these findings would suggest cortical defects. One possible reason may be that ascending dopamine deficiency may affect prefrontal circuits involved in the mnemonic coding of visual space. Another explanation would be that higher cortical structures are affected. These were indeed found to be the hippocampus (involved in short-term memory, which is the first type of memory to decline with age) and the brain amygdala, which influences autonomic and neurosecretory nuclei in the hypothalamus, and therefore the endocrine system. Neuroendocrine correlations, as was the previous one between melatonin and dopamine, would lead to completely novel physiological hypotheses.\nA young immunologist would seek the revival of the abandoned autoimmune theory and would note that in PD the glial cells start phagocytizing neurons and express the HLA-DR antigen which is absent in controls; glial cells may signal to the periphery since they also express receptors for interleukin 2 which is secreted presumably only by T-cells [37]. A pharmacologist would probably have the strongest arguments for a research proposal. Antipsychotic medication in the form of neuroleptics prescribed for schizophrenia and mania (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol) act by blocking the dopamine receptors and induce side effects as tardive dyskinesia, depigmentation of the SN neurons and skin sensitivity .

It is now a fact that these drugs specifically bind melanins and this interaction may be analyzed in vivo by various methods, for example whole body autoradiography to study the distribution of radioactively labeled drugs in pigmented and albino mice. The double role of chlorpromazine as a free radical scavenger and a generator of toxic metabolites should also be taken into consideration..

In addition, detection of polysaccharide antigens in body fluids by immunologic assays has been advanced, and constitutes an important diagnostic tool in different clinical scenarios. The polysaccharides detected are galactomannans of Aspergillus spp., 9 and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others,  and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others, 11 and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans.  and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans. 12 However, a major problem is the occurrence of false-positive results related in some cases to cross-reactivity with other fungi.

QAR:\nQuestion: What is the significance of O-linked oligosaccharides in A. fumigatus and their potential impact on drug development?\nAnswer: O-linked oligosaccharides have been found to be structurally similar to N-linked glycans, and this suggests that the same glycosyl transferases may modify both types of glycans in A. fumigatus, as occurs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding has important implications for understanding the physiology of medically important fungi and could potentially lead to new targets for antifungal treatment.\nReason: The discovery that O-linked oligosaccharides are structurally similar to N-linked glycans suggests that they may be recognized by the same glycosyl transferases, which could provide potential targets for drug development in A. fumigatus.\n2. QAR:\nQuestion: How does the presence of distinct galactofuranose antigens in the cell wall and culture supernatants differentiate Fusarium from Aspergillus species?\nAnswer: The presence of distinct galactofuranose antigens in the cell wall as well as in culture supernatants is proposed as a strategy to differentiate Fusarium from Aspergillus species.\nReason: The detection of a Galf-containing antigen of unknown structure in supernatants of several Fusarium species using a novel monoclonal antibody, which is also present in minor amounts in hyphae of A. fumigatus, differentiates Fusarium from Aspergillus species through the presence of distinct galactofuranose antigens in the cell wall and culture supernatants.\n3. QAR:\nQuestion: What are the implications of O-linked oligosaccharides for the immune response against A. fumigatus?\nAnswer: O-linked oligosaccharides are key determinants for the phagocytosis of conidia by murine macrophages and induction of the inflammatory response, as de-O-glycosylated PGM (lacking O-linked chains) was not able to inhibit F. oxysporum phagocytosis, suggesting that O-linked oligosaccharides may play a role in the immune response against A. fumigatus.\nReason: The role of O-linked oligosaccharides in the immune response against A. fumigatus has not been fully elucidated, but their importance as key determinants for phagocytosis suggests that they may play a significant role in host defense against this fungus.\n4. QAR:\nQuestion: How does the cross-reactivity of serum galactomannan testing impact the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fusariosis?\nAnswer: The presence of distinct galactofuranose antigens in Fusarium species, which are recognized by a serum monoclonal antibody directed against galactofuranosyl residues, could potentially be used for early diagnosis of invasive fusariosis.\nReason: Early diagnosis of invasive fusariosis is important for effective treatment and management of the disease. The detection of distinct galactofuranose antigens in Fusarium species using a serum monoclonal antibody could provide a potential tool for early diagnosis of this disease.\n5.

In addition, detection of polysaccharide antigens in body fluids by immunologic assays has been advanced, and constitutes an important diagnostic tool in different clinical scenarios. The polysaccharides detected are galactomannans of Aspergillus spp., 9 and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others,  and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others, 11 and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans.  and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans. 12 However, a major problem is the occurrence of false-positive results related in some cases to cross-reactivity with other fungi. This was confirmed for the commercial galactomannan test, Platelia EIA. The epitope, (1\u21925)-\u03b2-D-galactofuranoside side chains of the Aspergillus galactomannan, detected by the EB-A2 monoclonal antibody employed in the test is not exclusively present in Aspergillus species. This epitope may be present in antigens of other fungi, including Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Trichothecium, Myceliophthora, Blastomyces dermatitidis, H. capsulatum, as well as Geotrichum capitatum, Trichosporon species, Acremonium species, Alternaria alternate and Fusarium species.

The role of carbohydrate epitopes in antigenic reactivity of purified PGM]\nTo evaluate the role of the carbohydrate epitopes of the PGM in the ELISA reaction, rabbit anti-serum was tested against PGM submitted to periodate oxidation, and \u03b2-elimination treatment (removal of O-linked oligosaccharides).\nThe antigenic epitopes were, in large part, carbohydrate in nature. Periodate oxidation abolished much of the PGM antigenic activity (Fig. 5A). A strong decrease in reactivity was also observed with de-O-glycosylated PGM (lacking O-linked oligosaccharide chains) (Fig. ). A strong decrease in reactivity was also observed with de-O-glycosylated PGM (lacking O-linked oligosaccharide chains) (Fig. 5B).).\n\n[17. Involvement of PGM on phagocytosis of F. oxysporum by macrophages]\nTo evaluate whether PGM and its O-linked oligosaccharides are involved in F. oxysporum uptake, macrophages were pretreated with 50 \u00b5g/ml intact and de-O-glycosylated PGM for 30 min before interaction with F. oxysporum conidia for 2 h. The conidia to macrophage ratio was adjusted to 5:1. Pretreatment of the macrophages with intact PGM led to the inhibition of conidia phagocytosis, whereas de-O-glycosylated PGM did not show any inhibition on macrophage conidia internalization (Fig. 6). These results reveal that macrophages recognize and internalize F. oxysporum via PGM, and demonstrate that O-glycosylation plays a role in this process. These results are in agreement with the previous one 29 using a peptidorhamnomannan from S. prolificans and its de-O-glycosylated derivative.).

These results are in agreement with the previous one 29 using a peptidorhamnomannan from S. prolificans and its de-O-glycosylated derivative.\n\n[18. Cytotoxic assay of F. oxysporum PGM]\nThe cytotoxicity of soluble PGM was assessed by the neutral red dye-uptake method. At PGM and de-O-glycosylated PGM concentrations, ranging from 7.8 to 500 \u00b5g/ml the macrophages viability was more than 90%.\n\n[19. Pro-inflammatory cytokine release induced by F. oxysporum PGM]\nThe role PGM plays in F. oxysporum conidia induction of TNF-\u03b1, a distinct proinflammatory cytokine, and of the anti-inflammatory IL-10, by macrophages was examined (Fig. 7). The TNF-\u03b1 cytokine was produced by the macrophages stimulated with conidia and with intact PGM (Fig. ). The TNF-\u03b1 cytokine was produced by the macrophages stimulated with conidia and with intact PGM (Fig. 7A). When de-O-glycosylated PGM was tested, a significant increase in cytokine levels was observed for TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. ). When de-O-glycosylated PGM was tested, a significant increase in cytokine levels was observed for TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 7A). However, conidia, intact or de-O-glycosylated PGM were not able to stimulate IL-10 cytokine secretion (Fig. ). However, conidia, intact or de-O-glycosylated PGM were not able to stimulate IL-10 cytokine secretion (Fig. 7B).).\n\n[20.

Treatment with dilute acid, which removed labile galactofuranosyl sidechain residues, decreased the antigenicity of Cladosporium PGM (Fig. ). Treatment with dilute acid, which removed labile galactofuranosyl sidechain residues, decreased the antigenicity of Cladosporium PGM (Fig. 8B). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in Fusarium PGM showing that this molecule does not contain Galf (1\u21925) Galf moieties (Fig. ). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in Fusarium PGM showing that this molecule does not contain Galf (1\u21925) Galf moieties (Fig. 8B) as confirmed by structural analysis. We now report the structural characterization of a PGM from F. oxysporum by a combination of chemical and spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR presenting a diferent structure as the one previously described in Aspergillus species.

Treatment of PGM with sodium metaperiodate and release of O-linked oligosaccharides by reductive beta elimination reaction strongly decreased the antibody binding capacity.

This suggests that the same glycosyl transferases that modify N-glycans may also modify N-glycans in A. fumigatus, as occurs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 41 To detect the occurrence of O-glycosylation in a growing number of medically important fungi may be an important step toward the better understanding of their physiology and may be useful for providing potential targets for drug development. The findings of Komach et al. (2013) and Katafuchi et al. (2017) about the GfsA suggest that GfsA activity maybe a potential target for antifungal treatment.

In conclusion, our results showed that galactofuranosyl residues typically occur in the PGM as side chains with repeating \u03b2-Galf-(1\u21925) units linked to a mannose backbone consisting of (1\u21926)-linked \u03b1-D-mannopyranosyl residues. ).

The outcome of invasive aspergillosis has improved in the last decade, and one of the reasons is the early diagnosis of the disease, achieved after the introduction of serum galactomannan testing. 47 With this regard, a test that is sensitive and specific, and appears in the serum before the clinical manifestations of invasive fusariosis may have an impact in decreasing the mortality of this devastating disease.

Glucose consumption is tightly coupled to the need for energy (ATP), which in the brain largely reflects neuronal activity, or more specifically, depolarization of neuronal cell membranes. The membrane potential derives from the ionic gradients created by ion pumps that transport sodium and potassium against their concentration gradients across cell membranes, an activity that is fuelled by ATP (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001). Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. .

This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. ). This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. 2). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. ). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Shank et al., 1993;Mason et al., 1999;see Figs. 1 and 2)..\nHowever, when \u03b1-ketoglutarate is metabolized further through the TCA cycle, succinate is formed. Succinate has four carbon atoms and is symmetrical, so the label is now scrambled between the 1 st + 2 nd positions and the 3 rd + 4 th positions (or the 2 nd and 3 rd positions if [1-13 C]glucose is being used). From succinate fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate are formed before another molecule of acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form citrate. The labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate correspond to the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate. Labeling of these positions in glutamate reflects passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Fig. 1 and and2). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated ). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated (Hassel et al., 1995a;1997;Mason et al., 1999;Hyder et al., 2003).

Pyruvate may also become aminated to alanine or reduced to lactate.\nOxaloacetate equilibrates with aspartate, and whereas oxaloacetate at a tissue concentration of ~10 \uf020nmol/g brain tissue (Siesj\u00f6, 1978) defies detection by 13 C MRS, aspartate is readily detected, especially its 2 nd and 3 rd carbon positions, the labeling of which reflects the passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Figs.  defies detection by 13 C MRS, aspartate is readily detected, especially its 2 nd and 3 rd carbon positions, the labeling of which reflects the passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Figs. 1 and and2). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons ). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons (Ottersen and Storm-Mathisen, 1985;Hassel et al., 1992;1995b). With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose . With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a;Johannessen et al., 2001)..\nInhibition of TCA cycle activity by drugs or toxins may reduce the 13 C labeling of glutamate, GABA, or glutamine from [ 13 C]glucose (e.g. Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a). But because TCA cycle activity is closely coupled to neuronal activity, any influence that reduces brain activity (e.g. anesthetics, antiepileptic drugs) will reduce glucose metabolism in the brain and hence 13 C labeling of glucose metabolites. Therefore, a reduction in the labeling of cerebral metabolites from [ 13 C]glucose must be interpreted with some caution. Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition..

Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition.\nConversely, any influence that leads to increased activation of the brain may increase glucose metabolism and increase 13 C labeling from [ 13 C]glucose. Such effects have been seen in human subjects and in rats (Hyder et al., 1996;Patel et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that although previous studies on a variety of experimentally induced conditions, including epileptic seizures and stroke, have shown increased uptake of the glucose analogue deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (PET) or autoradiographic methods, data obtained with 13 C MRS seem to indicate that the oxidative metabolism of glucose may be only little affected or even reduced .

The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury . The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury (Bartnik et al., 2007;Scafidi et al., 2009). Deoxyglucose is a substrate for the glucose transporter in the blood-brain barrier and in neurons, as well as for the first enzyme of glucose metabolism, hexokinase, which phopsphorylates glucose and deoxyglucose to their 6-phospho-derivatives. But once phophorylated deoxyglucose is not metabolized further and accumulates intracellularly; this allows its detection by PET or autoradiography. It follows that the deoxyglucose-based methods strictly detect the transport and initial phosphorylation of deoxyglucose, whereas 13 C MRS detection of glutamate labeling from [ 13 C]glucose reflects both glycolytic and oxidative metabolic activity in the brain..

It soon became clear, however, that the increase in glucose metabolism caused by various forms of physiological activation, was quite small, and not always readily detectable on the background of a high basal metabolic rate in the unanesthetized brain (Shulman et al., 2004)..", "Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocytes and neurons": "The cellular complexity of the brain makes it difficult to assess the metabolic activity of individual cell types separately. However, because some metabolic pathways are unique to certain cells, and because some metabolic substrates are metabolized selectively by certain cell types, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible. First we consider the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons as a precursor for glutamate and GABA in neurons. Thereafter we discuss the transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes during glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nIn the brain, acetate is metabolized oxidatively by astrocytes and not by neurons. Because astrocytes express glutamine synthetase (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 1977), isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den , isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den Berg et al., 1969;Hassel et al., 1997;Lebon et al., 2002;Deelchand et al., 2009). Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase . Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001), a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons.

Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. . Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. 3) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA ) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA (Hassel et al., 1997). An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. . An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. Waniewski and Martin (1998) provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes.

This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters (Bergersen, 2007). . Nguyen et al (2007b) later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase  later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons.

GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons . GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons (Schousboe et al., 1974), and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives., and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives.\nBecause glutamate is readily labeled from 13 C-labeled precursors, there has been considerable interest in identifying transmitter glutamate with 13 C MRS. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves many functions in the brain, it has been estimated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain glutamate serves a neurotransmitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006). After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine . After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine (Danbolt, 2001). This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate . This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate (Hassel et al., 1997). The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. . The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 4).).\nThe exchange between neurons and astrocytes of glutamate and glutamine has been the subject of many studies, in both human subjects and experimental animals (Shen et al., 1999; see  see Rothman et al., 1999;2003, for review). Interpretation of 13 C MRS after infusion of 13 Clabeled glucose into awake humans indicated that the flux of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was close to 50% of the cerebral metabolism of glucose. This would suggest a massive transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes. However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles..

As will become evident below ('Identification of alternative substrates for brain energy metabolism'), lactate and pyruvate have become regarded as more purely neuronal substrates that are used by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons alike, whereas glycerol appears to be a substrate specifically used by GABAergic neurons (Nguyen et al., 2003). Thus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combining the administration of an appropriate 13 C-labeled energy substrate with 13 C MRS.  .

Uptake of transmitter glutamate by astrocytes. In this experiment mice received the glia-specific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate, which blocks the astrocytic TCA cycle at the level of aconitase. Thus, the ability of astrocytes to form glutamate and hence glutamine from \u03b1-ketoglutarate from their own TCA cycle was blocked. Even so, glutamine was formed from [ 13 C]glucose, presumably because 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate was still being released from neurons and taken up by astrocytes with subsequent formation of [ 13 C]glutamine. The upper spectrum is from the brain of a mouse that received [1,2-13 C]acetate and [1-13 C]glucose. The doubly labeled acetate gives rise to the double peaks in glutamine C4 (peak 7).

Even so, a number of substrates may feed into the glycolytic pathway or the TCA cycle of brain cells. For example, lactate, which was shown by 13 C MRS to be a substrate for brain metabolism in mice (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000), was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions , was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions (Gallagher et al., 2009;Boumezbeur et al., 2010). The ability of a substrate to function as a metabolic substrate for brain cells depends on its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, i.e. on the presence of specific transporter proteins in the barrier. Further, brain cells must have the necessary transporters to take the substrates up from the extracellular fluid as well as the enzymes necessary for their metabolism. A substrate that is not metabolized in the brain after i.v. injection may prove to be metabolized after intracerebral injection, a finding that points to transport limitations at the blood-brain barrier; this holds true for dicarboxylates like fumarate and malate .

A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose ; if injected directly into the brain parenchyma, these substrates are taken up into astrocytes and rapidly metabolized through the TCA cycle to glutamine, indicating the presence of the plasma membrane dicarboxylate transporter predominantly in astrocytes. A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose (Hassel et al., submitted), which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, if fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro , which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all.

An example is propionate, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, but hardly becomes metabolized in the brain (Nguyen et al., 2007b;Morland et al., in prep). The enzymes required for the initial metabolism of propionate, propionyl-CoA synthetase is expressed at low levels, making it difficult to detect propionate metabolites by 13 C MRS after i.v. administration of [ 13 C]propionate to experimental animals. Cerebral metabolism of propionate may be detected with radiolabeled propionate, however, owing to the higher sensitivity of radiodetective methods (scintillation counting) than of 13 C MRS .

Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain (Ebert et al., 2003), suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3.

In fact, any 13 C-labeled substrate that gives rise to 13 C-labeled acetyl-CoA will label glutamate and glutamine in positions that reflect the entry of label into the TCA cycle and its subsequent turning in the cycle. This applies to 13 C-labeled lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate, glycerol, and others. However, substrates that give C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 39 rise to 13 C-labeled pyruvate in the brain (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glycerol) may enter the TCA cycle through two different enzymatic routes. The first, which gives rise to acetyl-CoA, is pyruvate dehydrogenase, which removes a carboxylic group from pyruvate in the form of CO 2 . The second route involves the addition of a carboxylic group (from CO 2 or HCO 3 -) to pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate or its immediate precursor malate (See upper part of Fig. 7); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme. These reactions are 'anaplerotic', meaning that they function to 'fill up' the TCA cycle with intermediates. They are thought to compensate for the loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in export of glutamine from astrocytes and for the similar loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission when (See below) astrocytes take up glutamate or GABA from the synaptic cleft. Decarboxylation of these malates produces 13 CO 2 as well as unlabeled CO 2 . The 13 C is represented in italics.); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation.

The 13 C is represented in italics.\nWhen pyruvate is 13 C-labeled these reactions lead to the formation of 13 C-labeled malate and oxaloacetate. Pyruvate labeled in the 3 rd carbon (which originates from glucose labeled in the 1 st position, [1-13 C]glucose) leads to formation of malate or oxaloacetate labeled in the 3 rd carbon. This carbon position corresponds to the 2 nd carbon in glutamate and glutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2 nd than the 3 rd carbon in glutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes (Shank et al., 1993;Hassel et al., 1995a;Serres et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons. However, oxaloacetate and malate tend to equilibrate with the symmetrical fumarate, leading to scrambling of label between the two carbon position. 13 C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has been reported in both cultured neurons .

Another way to study pyruvate carboxylation is to use glucose labeled in the 2 nd position. Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13 C]glucose) does not label acetyl-CoA, but it may label the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through pyruvate carboxylation. .

Mason et al (2007) showed in awake human subjects the flux through pyruvate carboxylation to be approximately 6% of that through pyruvate dehydrogenase (the activity of which was studied with [1-13 C]glucose).

This process takes place in the brain (Cerdan et al., 1990;Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b;Cruz et al., 1998) as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate  as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b).

However, pyruvate recycling also occurs in cultured brain cells (astrocytes), in which hepatic gluconeogenesis is not an issue (Sonnewald et al., 1996)..\nWith the use of 13 C MRS Gruetter and colleagues were able to determine the concentration and turnover of glycogen in the intact brain (van Heeswijk et al., 2010), and they also described the formation of N-acetyl-aspartate, which is present in the brain at high concentrations, from [ 13 C]glucose, and they determined the turnover rate of this presumed 'inert' compound , and they also described the formation of N-acetyl-aspartate, which is present in the brain at high concentrations, from [ 13 C]glucose, and they determined the turnover rate of this presumed 'inert' compound (Choi et al., 2004)..", "The use of hyperpolarization of 13 C to increase MRS sensitivity": "A problem with 13 C MRS is the low sensitivity of the method. This weakness implies that 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates have to be given in large amounts to achieve detection of their metabolites. In contrast, radiolabeling studies are done with minute quantities of substrate. In an attempt to improve 13 C MRS sensitivity, hyperpolarization of 13 C-labeled substrates has been done prior to i.v. injection. The MRS signal may thus be enhanced more than 10,000 times (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003). In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used . In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used (Hurd et al., 2010;Marja\u0144ska et al., 2010;Mayer et al., 2011). The [ 13 C]pyruvate is hyperpolarized immediately before i.v. injection. The hyperpolarization is lost within some seconds, however, and the detection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13 C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see Fig. . The [ 13 C]pyruvate is hyperpolarized immediately before i.v. injection. The hyperpolarization is lost within some seconds, however, and the detection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13 C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see Fig. 2). Formation of 13 CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, i.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may enter the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the brain the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is quite low ). Formation of 13 CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, i.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may enter the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the brain the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is quite low (Morland et al., 2007), and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes , and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes (Gonzalez et al., 2005), so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. , so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 3): [ 13 C]pyruvate is carboxylated to [ 13 C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13 C is distributed evenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate. [ 13 C]Fumarate equilibrates with malate, which may become decarboxylated to pyruvate and CO 2 . Some of this CO 2 will then be 13 C-labeled. This series of reactions has been described in the brain with the use of [2-13 C]pyruvate and [3-13 C]pyruvate ): [ 13 C]pyruvate is carboxylated to [ 13 C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13 C is distributed evenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate.

What are some limitations of 13 C MRS and how have researchers attempted to overcome them?\nAnswer: One limitation of 13 C MRS is its low sensitivity, which requires large amounts of labeled substrates for detection. Researchers have tried to improve sensitivity by using hyperpolarized labeled substrates, such as [1-13 C]pyruvate. However, the use of anesthesia during studies with hyperpolarized substrates has been shown to reduce brain metabolism of 13 C-labeled substrates.\n2. How has the use of 13 C MRS contributed to our understanding of brain energy metabolism?\nAnswer: The use of 13 C MRS has provided valuable information on the fluxes and pathways of brain energy metabolism, such as glucose and lactate, in both healthy and disease states. It has also helped identify abnormalities in energy metabolism in various neurological conditions.\n3. What are some potential applications of 13 C MRS in the diagnostic workup of malignant tumors?\nAnswer: Studies have suggested that hyperpolarized [13 C]pyruvate may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring tumor response to therapy, as tumors tend to convert pyruvate into lactate at a greater rate than surrounding tissue. This could potentially serve as a non-invasive method for evaluating tumor metabolism and treatment efficacy.\n4. What are some of the advantages of 13 C MRS over other imaging techniques, such as PET or fMRI?\nAnswer: 13 C MRS offers several advantages, including its ability to directly measure metabolite concentrations in vivo, provide quantitative information on energy metabolism, and not requiring the injection of exogenous tracers. Additionally, it can be used to study brain function in human subjects without exposure to ionizing radiation.\n5. How have researchers used 13 C MRS to investigate the effects of anesthesia on brain metabolism?\nAnswer: Researchers have used 13 C MRS to investigate how anesthesia affects brain energy metabolism, particularly in terms of glucose and lactate concentrations.

An extensive review, which included an overview of technical aspects of 13 C MRS in studies of brain and cultured brain cells, appeared recently (Rodrigues et al., 2009)..", "13 C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism": "Glucose is considered the physiologic energy substrate of the brain and is used by all brain cells, neurons and glial cells alike. Glucose consumption is tightly coupled to the need for energy (ATP), which in the brain largely reflects neuronal activity, or more specifically, depolarization of neuronal cell membranes. The membrane potential derives from the ionic gradients created by ion pumps that transport sodium and potassium against their concentration gradients across cell membranes, an activity that is fuelled by ATP (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001). Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. .

This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. ). This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. 2). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. ). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Shank et al., 1993;Mason et al., 1999;see Figs. 1 and 2)..\nHowever, when \u03b1-ketoglutarate is metabolized further through the TCA cycle, succinate is formed. Succinate has four carbon atoms and is symmetrical, so the label is now scrambled between the 1 st + 2 nd positions and the 3 rd + 4 th positions (or the 2 nd and 3 rd positions if [1-13 C]glucose is being used). From succinate fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate are formed before another molecule of acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form citrate. The labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate correspond to the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate. Labeling of these positions in glutamate reflects passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Fig. 1 and and2). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated ). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated (Hassel et al., 1995a;1997;Mason et al., 1999;Hyder et al., 2003).

Glucose is metabolized glycolytically to pyruvate, which may undergo decarboxylation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction to become acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to condense with oxaloacetate (OAA) and form citrate. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA that contribute to citrate (and hence \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA) are shown in italics. Due to the symmetry of succinate these two carbons are distributed evenly between the C1+C2 positions and the C3+C4 positions in succinate and in fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate, which are formed downstream of succinate. Pyruvate may also become aminated to alanine or reduced to lactate.. Simplified scheme of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons ). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons (Ottersen and Storm-Mathisen, 1985;Hassel et al., 1992;1995b). With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose . With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a;Johannessen et al., 2001)..\nInhibition of TCA cycle activity by drugs or toxins may reduce the 13 C labeling of glutamate, GABA, or glutamine from [ 13 C]glucose (e.g. Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a). But because TCA cycle activity is closely coupled to neuronal activity, any influence that reduces brain activity (e.g. anesthetics, antiepileptic drugs) will reduce glucose metabolism in the brain and hence 13 C labeling of glucose metabolites. Therefore, a reduction in the labeling of cerebral metabolites from [ 13 C]glucose must be interpreted with some caution. Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition..

Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition.\nConversely, any influence that leads to increased activation of the brain may increase glucose metabolism and increase 13 C labeling from [ 13 C]glucose. Such effects have been seen in human subjects and in rats (Hyder et al., 1996;Patel et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that although previous studies on a variety of experimentally induced conditions, including epileptic seizures and stroke, have shown increased uptake of the glucose analogue deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (PET) or autoradiographic methods, data obtained with 13 C MRS seem to indicate that the oxidative metabolism of glucose may be only little affected or even reduced .

The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury (Bartnik et al., 2007;Scafidi et al., 2009). Deoxyglucose is a substrate for the glucose transporter in the blood-brain barrier and in neurons, as well as for the first enzyme of glucose metabolism, hexokinase, which phopsphorylates glucose and deoxyglucose to their 6-phospho-derivatives. But once phophorylated deoxyglucose is not metabolized further and accumulates intracellularly; this allows its detection by PET or autoradiography. It follows that the deoxyglucose-based methods strictly detect the transport and initial phosphorylation of deoxyglucose, whereas 13 C MRS detection of glutamate labeling from [ 13 C]glucose reflects both glycolytic and oxidative metabolic activity in the brain..

It soon became clear, however, that the increase in glucose metabolism caused by various forms of physiological activation, was quite small, and not always readily detectable on the background of a high basal metabolic rate in the unanesthetized brain (Shulman et al., 2004)..", "Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocytes and neurons": "The cellular complexity of the brain makes it difficult to assess the metabolic activity of individual cell types separately. However, because some metabolic pathways are unique to certain cells, and because some metabolic substrates are metabolized selectively by certain cell types, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible. First we consider the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons as a precursor for glutamate and GABA in neurons. Thereafter we discuss the transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes during glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nIn the brain, acetate is metabolized oxidatively by astrocytes and not by neurons. Because astrocytes express glutamine synthetase (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 1977), isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den , isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den Berg et al., 1969;Hassel et al., 1997;Lebon et al., 2002;Deelchand et al., 2009). Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase . Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001), a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons.

Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. . Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. 3) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA ) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA (Hassel et al., 1997). An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. . An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. Waniewski and Martin (1998) provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes.

This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters (Bergersen, 2007). . Nguyen et al (2007b) later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase  later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons.

GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons . GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons (Schousboe et al., 1974), and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives., and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives.\nBecause glutamate is readily labeled from 13 C-labeled precursors, there has been considerable interest in identifying transmitter glutamate with 13 C MRS. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves many functions in the brain, it has been estimated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain glutamate serves a neurotransmitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006). After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine . After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine (Danbolt, 2001). This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate . This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate (Hassel et al., 1997). The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. . The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 4).).\nThe exchange between neurons and astrocytes of glutamate and glutamine has been the subject of many studies, in both human subjects and experimental animals (Shen et al., 1999; see  see Rothman et al., 1999;2003, for review). Interpretation of 13 C MRS after infusion of 13 Clabeled glucose into awake humans indicated that the flux of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was close to 50% of the cerebral metabolism of glucose. This would suggest a massive transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes. However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles..

However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles.\nIn 13 C MRS studies of the brain, acetate is used as a glial substrate, and glucose is used as an energy substrate for all brain cells, but with a dominant contribution from (glutamatergic) neurons. As will become evident below ('Identification of alternative substrates for brain energy metabolism'), lactate and pyruvate have become regarded as more purely neuronal substrates that are used by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons alike, whereas glycerol appears to be a substrate specifically used by GABAergic neurons (Nguyen et al., 2003). Thus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combining the administration of an appropriate 13 C-labeled energy substrate with 13 C MRS.  . Thus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combining the administration of an appropriate 13 C-labeled energy substrate with 13 C MRS.  4. Uptake of transmitter glutamate by astrocytes. In this experiment mice received the glia-specific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate, which blocks the astrocytic TCA cycle at the level of aconitase. Thus, the ability of astrocytes to form glutamate and hence glutamine from \u03b1-ketoglutarate from their own TCA cycle was blocked. Even so, glutamine was formed from [ 13 C]glucose, presumably because 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate was still being released from neurons and taken up by astrocytes with subsequent formation of [ 13 C]glutamine. The upper spectrum is from the brain of a mouse that received [1,2-13 C]acetate and [1-13 C]glucose. The doubly labeled acetate gives rise to the double peaks in glutamine C4 (peak 7).

Even so, a number of substrates may feed into the glycolytic pathway or the TCA cycle of brain cells. For example, lactate, which was shown by 13 C MRS to be a substrate for brain metabolism in mice (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000), was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions , was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions (Gallagher et al., 2009;Boumezbeur et al., 2010). The ability of a substrate to function as a metabolic substrate for brain cells depends on its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, i.e. on the presence of specific transporter proteins in the barrier. Further, brain cells must have the necessary transporters to take the substrates up from the extracellular fluid as well as the enzymes necessary for their metabolism. A substrate that is not metabolized in the brain after i.v. injection may prove to be metabolized after intracerebral injection, a finding that points to transport limitations at the blood-brain barrier; this holds true for dicarboxylates like fumarate and malate .

A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose ; if injected directly into the brain parenchyma, these substrates are taken up into astrocytes and rapidly metabolized through the TCA cycle to glutamine, indicating the presence of the plasma membrane dicarboxylate transporter predominantly in astrocytes. A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose (Hassel et al., submitted), which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, if fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro , which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all.

An example is propionate, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, but hardly becomes metabolized in the brain (Nguyen et al., 2007b;Morland et al., in prep). The enzymes required for the initial metabolism of propionate, propionyl-CoA synthetase is expressed at low levels, making it difficult to detect propionate metabolites by 13 C MRS after i.v. administration of [ 13 C]propionate to experimental animals. Cerebral metabolism of propionate may be detected with radiolabeled propionate, however, owing to the higher sensitivity of radiodetective methods (scintillation counting) than of 13 C MRS .

Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain (Ebert et al., 2003), suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3.

In fact, any 13 C-labeled substrate that gives rise to 13 C-labeled acetyl-CoA will label glutamate and glutamine in positions that reflect the entry of label into the TCA cycle and its subsequent turning in the cycle. This applies to 13 C-labeled lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate, glycerol, and others. However, substrates that give C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 39 rise to 13 C-labeled pyruvate in the brain (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glycerol) may enter the TCA cycle through two different enzymatic routes. The first, which gives rise to acetyl-CoA, is pyruvate dehydrogenase, which removes a carboxylic group from pyruvate in the form of CO 2 . The second route involves the addition of a carboxylic group (from CO 2 or HCO 3 -) to pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate or its immediate precursor malate (See upper part of Fig. 7); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme. These reactions are 'anaplerotic', meaning that they function to 'fill up' the TCA cycle with intermediates. They are thought to compensate for the loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in export of glutamine from astrocytes and for the similar loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission when (See below) astrocytes take up glutamate or GABA from the synaptic cleft.

The 13 C is represented in italics.\nWhen pyruvate is 13 C-labeled these reactions lead to the formation of 13 C-labeled malate and oxaloacetate. Pyruvate labeled in the 3 rd carbon (which originates from glucose labeled in the 1 st position, [1-13 C]glucose) leads to formation of malate or oxaloacetate labeled in the 3 rd carbon. This carbon position corresponds to the 2 nd carbon in glutamate and glutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2 nd than the 3 rd carbon in glutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes (Shank et al., 1993;Hassel et al., 1995a;Serres et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons. However, oxaloacetate and malate tend to equilibrate with the symmetrical fumarate, leading to scrambling of label between the two carbon position. 13 C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has been reported in both cultured neurons .

Another way to study pyruvate carboxylation is to use glucose labeled in the 2 nd position.

This process takes place in the brain (Cerdan et al., 1990;Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b;Cruz et al., 1998) as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate  as it does in liver.

This weakness implies that 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates have to be given in large amounts to achieve detection of their metabolites. In contrast, radiolabeling studies are done with minute quantities of substrate. In an attempt to improve 13 C MRS sensitivity, hyperpolarization of 13 C-labeled substrates has been done prior to i.v. injection. The MRS signal may thus be enhanced more than 10,000 times (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003). In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used .

An extensive review, which included an overview of technical aspects of 13 C MRS in studies of brain and cultured brain cells, appeared recently (Rodrigues et al., 2009)..\n\n[2. 13 C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism]\nGlucose is considered the physiologic energy substrate of the brain and is used by all brain cells, neurons and glial cells alike. Glucose consumption is tightly coupled to the need for energy (ATP), which in the brain largely reflects neuronal activity, or more specifically, depolarization of neuronal cell membranes. The membrane potential derives from the ionic gradients created by ion pumps that transport sodium and potassium against their concentration gradients across cell membranes, an activity that is fuelled by ATP (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001). Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. .

This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. ). This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. 2). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. ). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Shank et al., 1993;Mason et al., 1999;see Figs. 1 and 2)..\nHowever, when \u03b1-ketoglutarate is metabolized further through the TCA cycle, succinate is formed. Succinate has four carbon atoms and is symmetrical, so the label is now scrambled between the 1 st + 2 nd positions and the 3 rd + 4 th positions (or the 2 nd and 3 rd positions if [1-13 C]glucose is being used). From succinate fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate are formed before another molecule of acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form citrate. The labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate correspond to the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate. Labeling of these positions in glutamate reflects passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Fig. 1 and and2). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated ). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated (Hassel et al., 1995a;1997;Mason et al., 1999;Hyder et al., 2003).

Glucose is metabolized glycolytically to pyruvate, which may undergo decarboxylation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction to become acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to condense with oxaloacetate (OAA) and form citrate. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA that contribute to citrate (and hence \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA) are shown in italics. Due to the symmetry of succinate these two carbons are distributed evenly between the C1+C2 positions and the C3+C4 positions in succinate and in fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate, which are formed downstream of succinate. Pyruvate may also become aminated to alanine or reduced to lactate.. Simplified scheme of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Glucose is metabolized glycolytically to pyruvate, which may undergo decarboxylation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction to become acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to condense with oxaloacetate (OAA) and form citrate. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA that contribute to citrate (and hence \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA) are shown in italics. Due to the symmetry of succinate these two carbons are distributed evenly between the C1+C2 positions and the C3+C4 positions in succinate and in fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate, which are formed downstream of succinate. Pyruvate may also become aminated to alanine or reduced to lactate.\nOxaloacetate equilibrates with aspartate, and whereas oxaloacetate at a tissue concentration of ~10 \uf020nmol/g brain tissue (Siesj\u00f6, 1978) defies detection by 13 C MRS, aspartate is readily detected, especially its 2 nd and 3 rd carbon positions, the labeling of which reflects the passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Figs.  defies detection by 13 C MRS, aspartate is readily detected, especially its 2 nd and 3 rd carbon positions, the labeling of which reflects the passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Figs. 1 and and2). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons ). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons (Ottersen and Storm-Mathisen, 1985;Hassel et al., 1992;1995b). With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose . With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a;Johannessen et al., 2001)..\nInhibition of TCA cycle activity by drugs or toxins may reduce the 13 C labeling of glutamate, GABA, or glutamine from [ 13 C]glucose (e.g. Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a). But because TCA cycle activity is closely coupled to neuronal activity, any influence that reduces brain activity (e.g. anesthetics, antiepileptic drugs) will reduce glucose metabolism in the brain and hence 13 C labeling of glucose metabolites. Therefore, a reduction in the labeling of cerebral metabolites from [ 13 C]glucose must be interpreted with some caution. Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition..

Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition.\nConversely, any influence that leads to increased activation of the brain may increase glucose metabolism and increase 13 C labeling from [ 13 C]glucose. Such effects have been seen in human subjects and in rats (Hyder et al., 1996;Patel et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that although previous studies on a variety of experimentally induced conditions, including epileptic seizures and stroke, have shown increased uptake of the glucose analogue deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (PET) or autoradiographic methods, data obtained with 13 C MRS seem to indicate that the oxidative metabolism of glucose may be only little affected or even reduced .

The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury . The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury (Bartnik et al., 2007;Scafidi et al., 2009). Deoxyglucose is a substrate for the glucose transporter in the blood-brain barrier and in neurons, as well as for the first enzyme of glucose metabolism, hexokinase, which phopsphorylates glucose and deoxyglucose to their 6-phospho-derivatives. But once phophorylated deoxyglucose is not metabolized further and accumulates intracellularly; this allows its detection by PET or autoradiography. It follows that the deoxyglucose-based methods strictly detect the transport and initial phosphorylation of deoxyglucose, whereas 13 C MRS detection of glutamate labeling from [ 13 C]glucose reflects both glycolytic and oxidative metabolic activity in the brain..

It soon became clear, however, that the increase in glucose metabolism caused by various forms of physiological activation, was quite small, and not always readily detectable on the background of a high basal metabolic rate in the unanesthetized brain (Shulman et al., 2004)..\n\n[3. Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocytes and neurons]\nThe cellular complexity of the brain makes it difficult to assess the metabolic activity of individual cell types separately. However, because some metabolic pathways are unique to certain cells, and because some metabolic substrates are metabolized selectively by certain cell types, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible. First we consider the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons as a precursor for glutamate and GABA in neurons. Thereafter we discuss the transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes during glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nIn the brain, acetate is metabolized oxidatively by astrocytes and not by neurons. Because astrocytes express glutamine synthetase (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 1977), isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den , isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den Berg et al., 1969;Hassel et al., 1997;Lebon et al., 2002;Deelchand et al., 2009). Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase . Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001), a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons. In GABAergic neurons C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 33 the glutamine-derived glutamate becomes decarboxylated to GABA by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme that in the brain is expressed in inhibitory GABAergic neurons , a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons.

Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. . Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. 3) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA ) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA (Hassel et al., 1997). An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. . An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. Waniewski and Martin (1998) provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes. This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters  provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes. This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters (Bergersen, 2007). . Nguyen et al (2007b) later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase  later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase (Hassel et al., unpublished). GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons . GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons (Schousboe et al., 1974), and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives., and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives.\nBecause glutamate is readily labeled from 13 C-labeled precursors, there has been considerable interest in identifying transmitter glutamate with 13 C MRS. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves many functions in the brain, it has been estimated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain glutamate serves a neurotransmitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006). After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine . After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine (Danbolt, 2001). This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate . This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate (Hassel et al., 1997). The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. . The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 4).).\nThe exchange between neurons and astrocytes of glutamate and glutamine has been the subject of many studies, in both human subjects and experimental animals (Shen et al., 1999; see  see Rothman et al., 1999;2003, for review). Interpretation of 13 C MRS after infusion of 13 Clabeled glucose into awake humans indicated that the flux of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was close to 50% of the cerebral metabolism of glucose. This would suggest a massive transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes. However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles..

However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles.\nIn 13 C MRS studies of the brain, acetate is used as a glial substrate, and glucose is used as an energy substrate for all brain cells, but with a dominant contribution from (glutamatergic) neurons. As will become evident below ('Identification of alternative substrates for brain energy metabolism'), lactate and pyruvate have become regarded as more purely neuronal substrates that are used by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons alike, whereas glycerol appears to be a substrate specifically used by GABAergic neurons (Nguyen et al., 2003). Thus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combining the administration of an appropriate 13 C-labeled energy substrate with 13 C MRS.  .

Uptake of transmitter glutamate by astrocytes. In this experiment mice received the glia-specific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate, which blocks the astrocytic TCA cycle at the level of aconitase. Thus, the ability of astrocytes to form glutamate and hence glutamine from \u03b1-ketoglutarate from their own TCA cycle was blocked. Even so, glutamine was formed from [ 13 C]glucose, presumably because 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate was still being released from neurons and taken up by astrocytes with subsequent formation of [ 13 C]glutamine. The upper spectrum is from the brain of a mouse that received [1,2-13 C]acetate and [1-13 C]glucose. The doubly labeled acetate gives rise to the double peaks in glutamine C4 (peak 7).

Identification of alternative substrates for brain energy metabolism]\nSerum glucose is considered the physiological energy substrate of the brain. Even so, a number of substrates may feed into the glycolytic pathway or the TCA cycle of brain cells. For example, lactate, which was shown by 13 C MRS to be a substrate for brain metabolism in mice (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000), was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions , was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions (Gallagher et al., 2009;Boumezbeur et al., 2010). The ability of a substrate to function as a metabolic substrate for brain cells depends on its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, i.e. on the presence of specific transporter proteins in the barrier. Further, brain cells must have the necessary transporters to take the substrates up from the extracellular fluid as well as the enzymes necessary for their metabolism. A substrate that is not metabolized in the brain after i.v. injection may prove to be metabolized after intracerebral injection, a finding that points to transport limitations at the blood-brain barrier; this holds true for dicarboxylates like fumarate and malate .

A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose ; if injected directly into the brain parenchyma, these substrates are taken up into astrocytes and rapidly metabolized through the TCA cycle to glutamine, indicating the presence of the plasma membrane dicarboxylate transporter predominantly in astrocytes. A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose (Hassel et al., submitted), which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, if fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro , which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts.

The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro (Meakin et al., 2007)..\nEven though a substrate crosses the blood-brain barrier, the enzymatic machinery required for its metabolism may not be present in the brain. An example is propionate, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, but hardly becomes metabolized in the brain (Nguyen et al., 2007b;Morland et al., in prep). The enzymes required for the initial metabolism of propionate, propionyl-CoA synthetase is expressed at low levels, making it difficult to detect propionate metabolites by 13 C MRS after i.v. administration of [ 13 C]propionate to experimental animals. Cerebral metabolism of propionate may be detected with radiolabeled propionate, however, owing to the higher sensitivity of radiodetective methods (scintillation counting) than of 13 C MRS .

The predominant labeling of glutamate (over glutamine) points to a predominantly neuronal metabolism of these subtrates (Fig.  have been shown to be energy substrates for the brain after i.v. injection, pointing to the existence of the appropriate monocarboxylate transporters at the blood-brain barrier. The predominant labeling of glutamate (over glutamine) points to a predominantly neuronal metabolism of these subtrates (Fig. 5). Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain ). Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain (Ebert et al., 2003), suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3. Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocytes and neurons). The labeling of amino acids in the brain from [ 13 C]acetate is on a level similar to that achieved with [ 13 C]glucose , suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3.

Identification of metabolic pathways from the 13 C labeling of specific carbon positions in glutamate and glutamine]\nIn the second paragraph of this paper (' 13 C MRS for the visualization of brain energy metabolism') the 13 C labeling of glutamate from [ 13 C]glucose through TCA cycle activity is described. In fact, any 13 C-labeled substrate that gives rise to 13 C-labeled acetyl-CoA will label glutamate and glutamine in positions that reflect the entry of label into the TCA cycle and its subsequent turning in the cycle. This applies to 13 C-labeled lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate, glycerol, and others. However, substrates that give C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 39 rise to 13 C-labeled pyruvate in the brain (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glycerol) may enter the TCA cycle through two different enzymatic routes. The first, which gives rise to acetyl-CoA, is pyruvate dehydrogenase, which removes a carboxylic group from pyruvate in the form of CO 2 . The second route involves the addition of a carboxylic group (from CO 2 or HCO 3 -) to pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate or its immediate precursor malate (See upper part of Fig. 7); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme. These reactions are 'anaplerotic', meaning that they function to 'fill up' the TCA cycle with intermediates. They are thought to compensate for the loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in export of glutamine from astrocytes and for the similar loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission when (See below) astrocytes take up glutamate or GABA from the synaptic cleft. Decarboxylation of these malates produces 13 CO 2 as well as unlabeled CO 2 . The 13 C is represented in italics.); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme.

Decarboxylation of these malates produces 13 CO 2 as well as unlabeled CO 2 . The 13 C is represented in italics.\nWhen pyruvate is 13 C-labeled these reactions lead to the formation of 13 C-labeled malate and oxaloacetate. Pyruvate labeled in the 3 rd carbon (which originates from glucose labeled in the 1 st position, [1-13 C]glucose) leads to formation of malate or oxaloacetate labeled in the 3 rd carbon. This carbon position corresponds to the 2 nd carbon in glutamate and glutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2 nd than the 3 rd carbon in glutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes (Shank et al., 1993;Hassel et al., 1995a;Serres et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons. However, oxaloacetate and malate tend to equilibrate with the symmetrical fumarate, leading to scrambling of label between the two carbon position. 13 C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has been reported in both cultured neurons . A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons. However, oxaloacetate and malate tend to equilibrate with the symmetrical fumarate, leading to scrambling of label between the two carbon position. 13 C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has been reported in both cultured neurons (Merle et al., 1996) and in vivo  and in vivo (Hassel et al., 2000;Gonzalez et al., 2005). Another way to study pyruvate carboxylation is to use glucose labeled in the 2 nd position. Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13 C]glucose) does not label acetyl-CoA, but it may label the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through pyruvate carboxylation. .

Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13 C]glucose) does not label acetyl-CoA, but it may label the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through pyruvate carboxylation. Mason et al (2007) showed in awake human subjects the flux through pyruvate carboxylation to be approximately 6% of that through pyruvate dehydrogenase (the activity of which was studied with [1-13 C]glucose). This value was in good agreement with previous 13 C MRS studies in rats  showed in awake human subjects the flux through pyruvate carboxylation to be approximately 6% of that through pyruvate dehydrogenase (the activity of which was studied with [1-13 C]glucose). This value was in good agreement with previous 13 C MRS studies in rats (Shank et al., 1993) and with previous estimates based on radiolabeling studies (  and with previous estimates based on radiolabeling studies ( Van den Berg, 1973)..\nFormation of pyruvate from TCA cycle intermediates malate or oxaloacetate (through the decarboxylating activities of malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, respectively) is termed pyruvate recycling. This process takes place in the brain (Cerdan et al., 1990;Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b;Cruz et al., 1998) as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate  as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b). Such labeling can only occur through formation of pyruvate from TCA cycle intermediates. When pyruvate thus formed (and labeled) enters the TCA cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase a distinct labeling pattern may be seen in glutamate . Such labeling can only occur through formation of pyruvate from TCA cycle intermediates. When pyruvate thus formed (and labeled) enters the TCA cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase a distinct labeling pattern may be seen in glutamate (Cerdan et al., 1990;H\u00e5berg et al., 1998). Valid criticism of the interpretation of previous studies has come from . Valid criticism of the interpretation of previous studies has come from Serres et al. (2008) who pointed out that hepatic gluconeogenesis with 13 C labeling of serum glucose from [ 13 C]acetate may influence findings in the brain.

However, pyruvate recycling also occurs in cultured brain cells (astrocytes), in which hepatic gluconeogenesis is not an issue (Sonnewald et al., 1996)..\nWith the use of 13 C MRS Gruetter and colleagues were able to determine the concentration and turnover of glycogen in the intact brain (van Heeswijk et al., 2010), and they also described the formation of N-acetyl-aspartate, which is present in the brain at high concentrations, from [ 13 C]glucose, and they determined the turnover rate of this presumed 'inert' compound , and they also described the formation of N-acetyl-aspartate, which is present in the brain at high concentrations, from [ 13 C]glucose, and they determined the turnover rate of this presumed 'inert' compound (Choi et al., 2004)..\n\n[6. The use of hyperpolarization of 13 C to increase MRS sensitivity]\nA problem with 13 C MRS is the low sensitivity of the method. This weakness implies that 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates have to be given in large amounts to achieve detection of their metabolites. In contrast, radiolabeling studies are done with minute quantities of substrate. In an attempt to improve 13 C MRS sensitivity, hyperpolarization of 13 C-labeled substrates has been done prior to i.v. injection. The MRS signal may thus be enhanced more than 10,000 times (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003). In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used . In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used (Hurd et al., 2010;Marja\u0144ska et al., 2010;Mayer et al., 2011). The [ 13 C]pyruvate is hyperpolarized immediately before i.v. injection. The hyperpolarization is lost within some seconds, however, and the detection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13 C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see Fig. .

The hyperpolarization is lost within some seconds, however, and the detection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13 C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see Fig. 2). Formation of 13 CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, i.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may enter the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the brain the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is quite low ). Formation of 13 CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, i.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may enter the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the brain the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is quite low (Morland et al., 2007), and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes , and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes (Gonzalez et al., 2005), so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. , so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 3): [ 13 C]pyruvate is carboxylated to [ 13 C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13 C is distributed evenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate. [ 13 C]Fumarate equilibrates with malate, which may become decarboxylated to pyruvate and CO 2 . Some of this CO 2 will then be 13 C-labeled. This series of reactions has been described in the brain with the use of [2-13 C]pyruvate and [3-13 C]pyruvate ): [ 13 C]pyruvate is carboxylated to [ 13 C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13 C is distributed evenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate.

Some recent studies even suggest the possibility of monitoring tumor response to therapy from the reduced conversion of pyruvate into lactate within a day's time after irradiation or chemotherapy (Day et al., 2007;2011;Park et al., 2011)..\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 48768, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01148ebf-da32-4035-b135-2a74e4703a48": {"__data__": {"id_": "01148ebf-da32-4035-b135-2a74e4703a48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "H NMR studies of molecular interaction of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-Dglucosamine with capsaicin in aqueous and non-aqueous media", "authors": ["Inocencio Higuera-Ciapara", "Claudia Viru\u00e9s", "Marcela Jim\u00e9nez-Ch\u00e1vez", "Evelin Mart\u00ednez-Benavidez", "Javier Hern\u00e1ndez", "Zaira Dom\u00ednguez", "Roberto L\u00f3pez-Rend\u00f3n", "Enrique F Vel\u00e1zquez", "Motomichi Inoue", "Evelin Mart\u00ednez- Benavidez"], "Introduction": "Capsaicin, N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methyl-trans-6-nonenamide, is the major capsaicinoid of chili peppers (Capsicum spp.).

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na\u2082CO\u2082 and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22].

The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.\nSince the oxygen atoms are bound in an irregular manner, Equation 2 is invalid for the OH proton shifts, as the asymptotic titration curves of OH protons show a trend of saturation in a high concentration range as compared with the curve of NH 3 + (Figure 1).).\nThe broken lines in Figure 3  for n = 2.

Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55.

In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .", "Conclusion": "Protonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups. This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.

This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.\nThe above complexation schemes in aqueous media are suggestive of local interaction sites in nanocarriers based on chitosan, which is composed of glucosamine and Nacetylglucosamine (Scheme 1). The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin. This selective interaction is much more pronounced in basic media in which glucosamine is not protonated.", "Self-association in DMSO": "This section explains the calculation model and process of \u03b4 given by Equation 2for selfassociation.

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements.

Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + .

Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55.

Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field . Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field [24,38,39].

The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ).

In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin.

Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups.

Experimental]\nCapsaicin (\u2265 95%), D-glucosamine hydrochloride (\u2265 99 %) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (\u2265 95 %) were supplied from Aldrich, and were confirmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR. All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na\u2082CO\u2082 and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22].

Self-association of glucosamine cation]\nThe 1 H NMR spectrum of glucosamine hydrochloride presents only the signals of \u03b1 form in DMSO. The chemical shifts \u03b4 are changed with the concentration, as represented in Figure 1 for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure  for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials section). The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations in Supplementary Materials section). The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes). The parameters are determined as K as = 490 (230) M -1 , \u03b4 ua = 7.750 (0.041) and \u03b4 as = 8.067 (0.008); the numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations, and M = mol dm -3 . Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.\nSince the oxygen atoms are bound in an irregular manner, Equation 2 is invalid for the OH proton shifts, as the asymptotic titration curves of OH protons show a trend of saturation in a high concentration range as compared with the curve of NH 3 + (Figure 1).).\nThe broken lines in Figure 3  for n = 2.

Complexation of glucosamine with capsaicin]\nComplexation with capsaicin has been studied for GlH + and Gl 0 species individually by selecting pD values in titrations: i.e., pD = 6.55 at which the mole fraction of GlH + is 0.98; pD = 9.55 at which the mole fraction of Gl 0 is 0.93. The pKa of capsaicin has been reported to be 9.76 and 9.93 [33,34]. Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit . Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55. Therefore, a titration at the selected pD gives practically the proper formation constant for each species At pD 9.55, the 1 H NMR signals of the CH(2) and CH(1) protons in both glucosamine isomers show significant shifts upon addition of capsaicin, as represented in Figure , capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55. Therefore, a titration at the selected pD gives practically the proper formation constant for each species At pD 9.55, the 1 H NMR signals of the CH(2) and CH(1) protons in both glucosamine isomers show significant shifts upon addition of capsaicin, as represented in Figure 10 and   and  S3 in Supplementary Materials). in Supplementary Materials).\nThe titration curves in Figure 11 show asymptotic decrease which is characteristic of 1:1complexation. Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually: show asymptotic decrease which is characteristic of 1:1complexation. Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually:\nIn these expressions, [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] and [\u03b2Gl 0 Cp] are the molar concentrations of capsaicin complexes with \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , respectively. In the fast exchange case, of each isomer is proportional to the mole fraction of the complex.\nHere jC\u03b1 and jC\u03b2 are the j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 values inherent in the signal j of the complexes of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms, respectively. The total concentrations of the isomers, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl , were obtained on the basis of the populations determined from the NMR signal intensities. Equations 13 and 14 can be expressed by a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , individually, as explained in Section 5.2 (Calculation models and processes). Least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 have determined the formation constants shown in Table 3. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.\nIn the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine at pD 9.55, the aromatic protons shift upfield with line-broadening, as presented in Figure 12, while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table , while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table S4 in Supplementary Materials). The changes in \u03b4 of the aromatic protons are plotted in Figure  in Supplementary Materials). The changes in \u03b4 of the aromatic protons are plotted in Figure 13. Complexed capsaicin exhibits proton signals averaged over the complexes of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, due to the fast exchange. As a consequence, K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 cannot be determined individually from the observed monotonic titration curves. The solid lines in Figure . Complexed capsaicin exhibits proton signals averaged over the complexes of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, due to the fast exchange. As a consequence, K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 cannot be determined individually from the observed monotonic titration curves. The solid lines in Figure 13 are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table  are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table 3 give underestimation for the true formation constant, due to the hydrogen bonds in the complex with glucosamine. Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction  give underestimation for the true formation constant, due to the hydrogen bonds in the complex with glucosamine. Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field . Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field [24,38,39]. The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table . The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure 14). Change in \u03b4 of other protons are less than 0.0035 in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers (cf. Table ). Change in \u03b4 of other protons are less than 0.0035 in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers (cf.

The absolute C values tend to be larger in the \u03b1-complex than in the \u03b2-complex;\nthe former may be in a closer contact in consistency with the larger K f\u03b1 values. In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

Complexation of N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin]\nThe complexation of N-acetylglucosamine was studied at pD 9.55 for comparison with glucosamine, although the former is not protonated in the ordinary pH range [40]; at pD 6.55, the solubility of capsaicin was too low for titrations. In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure ). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure S6 in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table  in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table S3). A novel phenomena found in the titration is that the populations of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms are changed in the presence of capsaicin: \u03b1 form is the majority with a population of 0.66 until the concentration This observation suggests indirectly the presence of hyperconjugative interactions operative at the anomeric carbon, although the interaction is too weak to form a complex with a definite composition. In summary, capsaicin has much stronger molecular interaction with deprotonated glucosamine than with the N-acetyl derivative.).

In summary, capsaicin has much stronger molecular interaction with deprotonated glucosamine than with the N-acetyl derivative.\n\n[7. Protonation of glucosamine]\nGlucosamine is in protonation-deprotonation equilibrium with a logarithmic protonation constant (equivalent to pKa) of 7.58 [29]. Since a common weak acid is dissociated in D 2 O at a pD higher than at the corresponding pH in H 2 O by ca. one unit . Since a common weak acid is dissociated in D 2 O at a pD higher than at the corresponding pH in H 2 O by ca. one unit [30,31], the protonation constant and the species distribution of glucosamine in D 2 O are required to be determined prior to NMR studies of complexation. Figure , the protonation constant and the species distribution of glucosamine in D 2 O are required to be determined prior to NMR studies of complexation. Figure 8 represents \u03b4 versus pD plots obtained for CH(1) and CH  represents \u03b4 versus pD plots obtained for CH(1) and CH (2) protons, which exhibit the most significant shifts in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms. For a single-step protonation, \u03b4 j of proton j is expressed by the following function of pD. protons, which exhibit the most significant shifts in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms. For a single-step protonation, \u03b4 j of proton j is expressed by the following function of pD.\nHere \u03b4 j0 and \u03b4 j1 are the \u03b4 j inherent in the deprotonated species (denoted by Gl 0 ) and that of the mono-protonated species (denoted by GlH + ), respectively, and K D is the protonation constant in expected to be more stable in \u03b1 form, enabling protonation at the higher pD. This distinction is supposed to be caused by the steric and stereoelectronic effects of the anomeric carbon [32]..\nThe to environment that may be altered with pD. The reversible conversion from A to B with increasing pD is defined by:\nHere [Gl 0 A ] and [Gl 0 B ] are the molar concentrations of Gl 0 under the influence of environments A and B, respectively. When the pD response of the interconversion is expressed by the logistic (or \"dose-response\") equation against pD, the population P of either form can be expressed by an extended formula of Equation 8 as follows.\nHere P 0B , P 0A , and P 1 are the populations intrinsic of Gl 0 B , Gl 0 A , and GlH + species, respectively, in either isomer, and K \u2032 D is an apparent protonation constant related to the population change.\n\n[8. M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D]\nIn the titrations at pD 6.55, at which glucosamine is fully protonated, the \u03b4 changes of capsaicin protons are much smaller than those at pD 9.55 (cf. Table S4). The largest change is observed for CH(2) protons for both isomers. Even their titration curves do not show asymptotic trends, which are difficult to interpret definitely (Figure ). The largest change is observed for CH(2) protons for both isomers. Even their titration curves do not show asymptotic trends, which are difficult to interpret definitely (Figure S5 in Supplementary Materials). in Supplementary Materials).\nTentative least-squares calculations based on the competitive complexation have estimated the formation constant to be of the order of 10 M -1 . Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .\n\n[9. Conclusion]\nProtonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups. This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine. Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine.

This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.\nThe above complexation schemes in aqueous media are suggestive of local interaction sites in nanocarriers based on chitosan, which is composed of glucosamine and Nacetylglucosamine (Scheme 1). The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin. This selective interaction is much more pronounced in basic media in which glucosamine is not protonated.\n\n[10. Self-association in DMSO]\nThis section explains the calculation model and process of \u03b4 given by Equation 2for selfassociation. The mass balance of the self-association is expressed by the following equation.for selfassociation. The mass balance of the self-association is expressed by the following equation.\nHere C Gl is the total molar concentration of glucosamine, and the summation is made from 2 to n depending on the degree of association. The summation of the geometric progression leads to the polynomial of x that is K as [Gl]:\nx -(n + 1)\nThe numerical solution of the polynomial gives x for a certain n, and hence [Gl] can be calculated for a given K as . Equation 2for \u03b4 is rewritten by:for \u03b4 is rewritten by:\nThe second term is replaced by C Gl -[Gl], and the third term is rewritten by a geometric progression as follows.\nThe summation of the geometrical progression to n leads to the following equation.\nSince [Gl] is obtained numerically from Equation 16for given K as values, \u03b4 is expressed as a function of K as by a series of numerical calculations. Least-squares fitting of an observed \u03b4 versus C Gl curve determines the association constant K as together with \u03b4 ua and \u03b4 as . In practical calculations, n was cut off at about 25 on the basis of the criterion n [Gl n ]/C Gl << 0.01 over the entire concentration C Gl in a titration run.

Competitive complexation in D 2 O]\nThis section explains the least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 defined by Equations 13 and 14 for the competitive complexation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers.\nThe concentrations in Equations 11 and 12 follow the mass balances expressed by:\nIn these expressions, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl are the total molar concentrations of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, respectively. Combination of Equations 11 and 12 with Equations 20-22 leads to the following cubic equation of X that is [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] for \u03b1 form.\n(\nHere\nThe same type of cubic equation is derived for \u03b2 form by interchanging subscripts \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the parameters. The cubic equations can be solved numerically for given K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 . A series of solutions gives [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] as a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , and leads to a pair of theoretical titration curves of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 against C Cp on the basis of Equations 13 and 14. Alternate curve fittings were carried out repeatedly on a pair of titration curves of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms as follows. The first least-squares calculation was executed for j\u03b1 by assuming K f\u03b2 = 0; the resulting K f\u03b1 is the formation constant for virtual non-competitive complexation. This value was employed for K f\u03b1 in the least-squares fitting of j\u03b2 , and the obtained K f\u03b2 was used in the next least-squares fitting of j\u03b1 . These alternate fittings were repeated until convergence in the parameters. The consistency was confirmed by changing the order of least-squares calculations for j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 .

In addition to including tests regarding the potency and more restrictive limits for impurities, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was introduced as an identity test. The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants .

The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants (6)..\nBecause China is responsible for roughly half of the world's pig production, about 60% of the heparin supply comes from this country. In recent years the US FDA has expressed significant interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market to mitigate the risk of supply chain issues due to the lack of source material and to diversify the source of heparin drugs globally (7). The FDA, assisted by experts coming from non-profit organizations, industries and academic institutions, is investigating the structural differences between porcine, and bovine heparins and their possible clinical implications. Previous studies extensively demonstrated structural differences between heparin from different animal and organ sources. Particularly, porcine mucosa heparin (PMH) is characterized by higher 6-O-sulfation compared to bovine mucosa heparin (BMH) (80% in PMH vs. 55% in BMH comparing the total amount of GlcNx,6S or 68% in PMH vs. 48% in BMH comparing the amount of GlcNS, 6S linked to IdoA2S) .

Despite the same animal source, bovine lung heparin (BLH) differs from BMH with higher 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation and lower content of GlcA and GlcNAc residues (11,12). By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation . By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation (13,14)..\nIn 2017 bovine mucosal heparin was readmitted to the market in Brazil, requiring the drafting of a new specific monograph. The NMR identification test of this new monograph includes an acceptance criterion for BMH corresponding to the ratio among the integral values of anomeric signals of glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated which is not satisfied by PMH spectra (15). In the present study an alternative method based on the measurements of the ratio between the intensity of diagnostic signals of the 1 H-NMR spectrum was proposed.

The method proposed here can distinguish BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH samples from one another, while the ANVISA approach is specific for BMH vs. PMH.\nRecently, quantitative 2D-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy was established as viable method to determine the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin and LMWH (16,17). The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin . The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin (18). This method, calculating the percentage of monosaccharide and disaccharide building blocks, can distinguish the heparin source as well as identify possible structural modification of the heparin chains induced by the purification process, often undetectable in one-dimensional NMR data. The HSQC method, applied to libraries of BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH heparin batches coming from different suppliers provided a basis set of characteristics for each heparin source and of their structural variability. Phosphate buffer solution was prepared as follows: 49.7 mg of sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrate (0.36 mmol), 202.9 mg of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14 mmol), and 0.92 mg deuterated EDTA d-16 (0.003 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of water. The pH was checked at 7.1. The solution was distributed into 5 mL aliquots and then lyophilized. Each aliquot was dissolved in about 1 mL of D2O and lyophilized again. Finally, the buffer was dissolved in 5 mL of deuterium oxide with 0.002% TSP (12 mM)..

Phosphate buffer solution was prepared as follows: 49.7 mg of sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrate (0.36 mmol), 202.9 mg of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14 mmol), and 0.92 mg deuterated EDTA d-16 (0.003 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of water. The pH was checked at 7.1. The solution was distributed into 5 mL aliquots and then lyophilized. Each aliquot was dissolved in about 1 mL of D2O and lyophilized again. Finally, the buffer was dissolved in 5 mL of deuterium oxide with 0.002% TSP (12 mM).", "Heparin Samples": "The heparin samples utilized in this study were obtained from 13 different producers.

Of the types tested here, proton NMR spectra of BMH have the most observable differences compared to other heparins. Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies ).

Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies (8,19). The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.. The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.\nThe idea to integrate diagnostic signals of carbon and proton NMR spectra to distinguish bovine and porcine heparin was first proposed by Casu et al. (8) and then by Tovar et al.  and then by Tovar et al. (20) and Fu et al.  and Fu et al. (14). The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil . The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil (15), uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively. However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure , uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively.

As reference signals we chose the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) and the acetyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) which have chemical shift values of 3.28 and 2.04 ppm, respectively, and are well separated from the other signals (annotated peaks 2 and 3 of Figure ), we decided to use different signals which had less interference from other monosaccharides.

For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure ). For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure 1). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure ). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure 2).).\nThe integral values of partially overlapped heparin signals can vary as a function of the magnetic field used, spectral resolution or by the natural structural variability of heparin (22). Moreover, the ANVISA method was designed to distinguish BMH from PMH, while the method discussed here aims to differentiate PMH, BMH, OMH, and BLH. For this reason, we evaluated the signal intensities instead of the integral values. Due to the polyelectrolyte characteristic of heparin, slight differences in the concentration, pH or ionic strength of the heparin solutions can induce small changes in chemical shift values.

Figure 3 shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer. The addition of buffer removes the small shifts observed in deuterium oxide, making the spectra more reproducible, and comparable by minimizing pH and ionic strength sources of variation.

The intensities of peaks 1 (3.87 ppm), 2 (3.28 ppm),  and 3 (2.05 ppm) were measured and the ratios 1:2 and 3:2 were calculated (Supplementary Tables 123456). Results, shown in Figure ). Results, shown in Figure 4, indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure , indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure 5 can be used to identify heparin types from each group from these ratios: first check the 1:2 ratio is between 1.21 and 1.88, to classify the sample as BMH, otherwise check the 3:2 ratio to decide among PMH, OMH, BLH, or an unknown source.

The limits of Figure 5 correspond to prediction intervals with 99% probability (see Experimental section). The PMH and OMH interval separation was the smallest, confirming the similarity of heparins from these two sources. The results were only marginally affected by the magnetic field strength (500 or 600 MHz) so the scheme can be adopted independently of the instrument used. correspond to prediction intervals with 99% probability (see Experimental section).

The results were only marginally affected by the magnetic field strength (500 or 600 MHz) so the scheme can be adopted independently of the instrument used.\nA repeatability study was performed using a PMH heparin batch to determine the precision of the method. Six NMR tubes of the same sample were prepared, and proton spectra were recorded on each sample using 16 or 8 scans, respectively. Results summarized in the Supplementary Table 7 show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans. show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans.\nA series of 20 BMH, 1 PMH, and 1 BLH provided by USP were analyzed by 1 H-NMR by two independent laboratories. Results obtained on BMH show a good comparability between the ranges and values obtained by the two laboratories (Table 2 and Supplementary Table  and Supplementary Table 8). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45. Both laboratories identified test samples (BLH and PMH) as non-compatible with BMH [r(1:2) \u2264 1]. However, while the BLH sample was correctly identified by both laboratories, laboratory 2 identified the PMH sample as OMH, since r(3:2) value (1.37) was within the range of mucosa ovine heparin. A more detailed analysis of the spectra reveals a lower spectral resolution of the PMH spectrum measured by laboratory 2, confirmed by the different width at half height of TSP between the two spectra (about 1 Hz and 5 Hz, for laboratory 1 and 2, respectively) (Figures ). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45.

The r(3:2) ratio value obtained from the spectrum measured by laboratory 2 on the same sample, comply with the resolution requirement (width at half height of TSP of 1.4 Hz), was 2.15, therefore compatible with PMH sample (Figures 5,6C). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.", "HSQC Analysis": "Quantitative HSQC was recently applied to heparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for calculating the percentage of monosaccharides and disaccharides by normalizing volumes with reference to the sum of volumes of signals corresponding to each monosaccharide type (glucosamines or uronic acids) and the same carbon proton pair type (17,18). This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources . This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources (10).  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables .  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables 9101112131415161718192021) and summarized in the box plots of Figure ) and summarized in the box plots of Figure 7. Notably, the monosaccharide composition of both glucosamine and uronic acid shows some variability within the same heparin source that is attributed to the natural variability of the starting material and to the different process conditions used by manufacturers to purify heparin from the crudes. However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure .

However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure 7). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods ). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods (8)..\nImportantly, differences which were not observable in the 1D proton spectra were clearly detected by the HSQC method. For instance, OMH, PMH, and BLH differ not only in the degree of acetylation of glucosamine residues (PMH>OMH>BLH) but also in the glucuronic acid content and non-sulfated iduronic acid content (PMH>OMH>BLH) (Figure 7). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.\nA further level of characterization involved the quantification of disaccharide sequences and minor features, such as the heparin biological activity related glucuronic acid linked to 3-Osulfated glucosamine (G-A * ) disaccharide that is a marker of the antithrombin-binding (ATb) pentasaccharide (23)..\nBecause the G-A * sequence was identified exclusively in the active pentasaccharide sequence, G-A * can be considered the marker of the heparin ATb site. The amount of G-A * has a certain variability within each heparin source (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources. In particular, the highest amount of G-A * was observed in the PMH samples (from 1.9 to 3.4%), while in the other species G-A * was always lower than 1.0 %, with the exception of one ovine sample for which the G-A * value reached 2.8%. Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences ), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources.

Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences (10)..\nIn addition, the presence of 2,3-epoxy gluonic acid (epoxide) and galacturonic acid were observed and are known to be formed during the alkali treatment of heparin that occurs during the heparin purification process (24). Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures . Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra. Notably, 15 of 39 BMH samples contain galacturonic acid ranging from 0.9 to 9.8% and 4 of 39 BMH samples contain epoxide (1.3to 4.8%). These large amounts of chemically modified structures can affect not only the activity of heparin but possibly also the pharmacokinetic and other biological properties and therefore the control of epoxide and galacturonic acid process related impurities levels in the heparin API manufacturing process would be recommended.), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra.

The method developed here, is an alternative to that proposed by ANVISA, that is able not only to distinguish BMH from PMH, but also to confirm that the sample was not manufactured from other heparin sources such as bovine lung or ovine mucosa. The method, based on measurement of a proton NMR spectrum, is not much different from that present in both US and EU pharmacopeias for the identification of PMH heparin. A method utilizing the intensity ratios among selected signals was indeed already used in several pharmacopeia monographs to detect the presence of possible unknown contaminant (7). Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.. Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.\nNevertheless, overlapping signals on the proton NMR spectra prevent signals of minor structural signatures to be detected. For example, the presence of epoxidated or galacturonic acid residues cannot be easily observed in 1D proton spectra, while their signals are well resolved in the 2D HSQC spectra. The possibility to use the HSQC spectra, not only to assign 1D superimposed proton signals but also to quantify the relative abundance of each residue of glycosaminoglycans, was recently proposed by different groups (17,18). These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants.

The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis (4)..\nEven if 2D HSQC would be preferable in terms of amount of information obtained, the need for instruments equipped with high sensitivity probes (for example, cryogenically cooled probes) and for operators skilled in NMR, will make the application of the HSQC method difficult for many analytical laboratories. Although lower resolution and containing less information than 2D data sets, 1D proton-NMR data can be used to distinguish heparin types in a facile manner and is very similar to a method that is already required by several pharmacopeias and more widely applicable to an analytical laboratory. However, the increasing sensitivity and accuracy of NMR spectrometers and the availability of software which allows the complete automatization of the spectra processing and analysis have made the HSQC methodology a viable information value added alternative for many laboratories and may become more widely accessible in the future.", "file_name": "1D_and_2D_HSQC_NMR_Two_Methods_to_Distin.grobid.tei.xml", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers_and_reasons": "1.

Subsequently, in the late 1980s there was a spike in the number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom. As a result of concerns with contamination of the heparin supply, bovine heparin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market, and currently porcine mucosa is the only source material for all heparin products approved in US and Europe .

In addition to including tests regarding the potency and more restrictive limits for impurities, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was introduced as an identity test.

The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants (6)..\nBecause China is responsible for roughly half of the world's pig production, about 60% of the heparin supply comes from this country. In recent years the US FDA has expressed significant interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market to mitigate the risk of supply chain issues due to the lack of source material and to diversify the source of heparin drugs globally (7). The FDA, assisted by experts coming from non-profit organizations, industries and academic institutions, is investigating the structural differences between porcine, and bovine heparins and their possible clinical implications. Previous studies extensively demonstrated structural differences between heparin from different animal and organ sources. Particularly, porcine mucosa heparin (PMH) is characterized by higher 6-O-sulfation compared to bovine mucosa heparin (BMH) (80% in PMH vs. 55% in BMH comparing the total amount of GlcNx,6S or 68% in PMH vs. 48% in BMH comparing the amount of GlcNS, 6S linked to IdoA2S) . The FDA, assisted by experts coming from non-profit organizations, industries and academic institutions, is investigating the structural differences between porcine, and bovine heparins and their possible clinical implications. Previous studies extensively demonstrated structural differences between heparin from different animal and organ sources. Particularly, porcine mucosa heparin (PMH) is characterized by higher 6-O-sulfation compared to bovine mucosa heparin (BMH) (80% in PMH vs. 55% in BMH comparing the total amount of GlcNx,6S or 68% in PMH vs. 48% in BMH comparing the amount of GlcNS, 6S linked to IdoA2S) (8,9) and different structures and distribution of antithrombin binding sequences  and different structures and distribution of antithrombin binding sequences (10). Despite the same animal source, bovine lung heparin (BLH) differs from BMH with higher 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation and lower content of GlcA and GlcNAc residues . Despite the same animal source, bovine lung heparin (BLH) differs from BMH with higher 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation and lower content of GlcA and GlcNAc residues (11,12). By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation . By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation (13,14)..\nIn 2017 bovine mucosal heparin was readmitted to the market in Brazil, requiring the drafting of a new specific monograph. The NMR identification test of this new monograph includes an acceptance criterion for BMH corresponding to the ratio among the integral values of anomeric signals of glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated which is not satisfied by PMH spectra (15). In the present study an alternative method based on the measurements of the ratio between the intensity of diagnostic signals of the 1 H-NMR spectrum was proposed. The method proposed here can distinguish BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH samples from one another, while the ANVISA approach is specific for BMH vs. PMH..

The method proposed here can distinguish BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH samples from one another, while the ANVISA approach is specific for BMH vs. PMH.\nRecently, quantitative 2D-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy was established as viable method to determine the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin and LMWH (16,17). The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin . The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin (18). This method, calculating the percentage of monosaccharide and disaccharide building blocks, can distinguish the heparin source as well as identify possible structural modification of the heparin chains induced by the purification process, often undetectable in one-dimensional NMR data. The HSQC method, applied to libraries of BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH heparin batches coming from different suppliers provided a basis set of characteristics for each heparin source and of their structural variability. Phosphate buffer solution was prepared as follows: 49.7 mg of sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrate (0.36 mmol), 202.9 mg of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14 mmol), and 0.92 mg deuterated EDTA d-16 (0.003 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of water. The pH was checked at 7.1. The solution was distributed into 5 mL aliquots and then lyophilized. Each aliquot was dissolved in about 1 mL of D2O and lyophilized again. Finally, the buffer was dissolved in 5 mL of deuterium oxide with 0.002% TSP (12 mM)..

Of the types tested here, proton NMR spectra of BMH have the most observable differences compared to other heparins. Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies ).

This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies (8,19). The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.. The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.\nThe idea to integrate diagnostic signals of carbon and proton NMR spectra to distinguish bovine and porcine heparin was first proposed by Casu et al. (8) and then by Tovar et al.  and then by Tovar et al. (20) and Fu et al.  and Fu et al. (14). The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil . The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil (15), uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively. However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure , uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively.

As reference signals we chose the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) and the acetyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) which have chemical shift values of 3.28 and 2.04 ppm, respectively, and are well separated from the other signals (annotated peaks 2 and 3 of Figure ), we decided to use different signals which had less interference from other monosaccharides.

For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure ). For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure 1). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure ). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure 2).).\nThe integral values of partially overlapped heparin signals can vary as a function of the magnetic field used, spectral resolution or by the natural structural variability of heparin (22). Moreover, the ANVISA method was designed to distinguish BMH from PMH, while the method discussed here aims to differentiate PMH, BMH, OMH, and BLH. For this reason, we evaluated the signal intensities instead of the integral values. Due to the polyelectrolyte characteristic of heparin, slight differences in the concentration, pH or ionic strength of the heparin solutions can induce small changes in chemical shift values.

Figure 3 shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer. The addition of buffer removes the small shifts observed in deuterium oxide, making the spectra more reproducible, and comparable by minimizing pH and ionic strength sources of variation. Moreover, to avoid variation of signal intensities due to bad spectral resolution from poor field homogeneity, a requirement of a minimum full width at half-height linewidth of the signal of deuterated trimethylsilylpropionic acid sodium salt (TSP), used as chemical shift reference, was introduced (see the Experimental Section). shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer.

The intensities of peaks 1 (3.87 ppm), 2 (3.28 ppm),  and 3 (2.05 ppm) were measured and the ratios 1:2 and 3:2 were calculated (Supplementary Tables 123456). Results, shown in Figure ). Results, shown in Figure 4, indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure , indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure 5 can be used to identify heparin types from each group from these ratios: first check the 1:2 ratio is between 1.21 and 1.88, to classify the sample as BMH, otherwise check the 3:2 ratio to decide among PMH, OMH, BLH, or an unknown source.

The results were only marginally affected by the magnetic field strength (500 or 600 MHz) so the scheme can be adopted independently of the instrument used.\nA repeatability study was performed using a PMH heparin batch to determine the precision of the method. Six NMR tubes of the same sample were prepared, and proton spectra were recorded on each sample using 16 or 8 scans, respectively. Results summarized in the Supplementary Table 7 show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans. show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans.\nA series of 20 BMH, 1 PMH, and 1 BLH provided by USP were analyzed by 1 H-NMR by two independent laboratories. Results obtained on BMH show a good comparability between the ranges and values obtained by the two laboratories (Table 2 and Supplementary Table  and Supplementary Table 8). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45. Both laboratories identified test samples (BLH and PMH) as non-compatible with BMH [r(1:2) \u2264 1]. However, while the BLH sample was correctly identified by both laboratories, laboratory 2 identified the PMH sample as OMH, since r(3:2) value (1.37) was within the range of mucosa ovine heparin. A more detailed analysis of the spectra reveals a lower spectral resolution of the PMH spectrum measured by laboratory 2, confirmed by the different width at half height of TSP between the two spectra (about 1 Hz and 5 Hz, for laboratory 1 and 2, respectively) (Figures ). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45.

The r(3:2) ratio value obtained from the spectrum measured by laboratory 2 on the same sample, comply with the resolution requirement (width at half height of TSP of 1.4 Hz), was 2.15, therefore compatible with PMH sample (Figures ). The r(3:2) ratio value obtained from the spectrum measured by laboratory 2 on the same sample, comply with the resolution requirement (width at half height of TSP of 1.4 Hz), was 2.15, therefore compatible with PMH sample (Figures 5,6C). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.", "HSQC Analysis": "Quantitative HSQC was recently applied to heparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for calculating the percentage of monosaccharides and disaccharides by normalizing volumes with reference to the sum of volumes of signals corresponding to each monosaccharide type (glucosamines or uronic acids) and the same carbon proton pair type (17,18). This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources . This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources (10).  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables .  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables 9101112131415161718192021) and summarized in the box plots of Figure ) and summarized in the box plots of Figure 7. Notably, the monosaccharide composition of both glucosamine and uronic acid shows some variability within the same heparin source that is attributed to the natural variability of the starting material and to the different process conditions used by manufacturers to purify heparin from the crudes. However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure .

However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure 7). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods ). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods (8)..\nImportantly, differences which were not observable in the 1D proton spectra were clearly detected by the HSQC method. For instance, OMH, PMH, and BLH differ not only in the degree of acetylation of glucosamine residues (PMH>OMH>BLH) but also in the glucuronic acid content and non-sulfated iduronic acid content (PMH>OMH>BLH) (Figure 7). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.\nA further level of characterization involved the quantification of disaccharide sequences and minor features, such as the heparin biological activity related glucuronic acid linked to 3-Osulfated glucosamine (G-A * ) disaccharide that is a marker of the antithrombin-binding (ATb) pentasaccharide (23)..\nBecause the G-A * sequence was identified exclusively in the active pentasaccharide sequence, G-A * can be considered the marker of the heparin ATb site. The amount of G-A * has a certain variability within each heparin source (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources. In particular, the highest amount of G-A * was observed in the PMH samples (from 1.9 to 3.4%), while in the other species G-A * was always lower than 1.0 %, with the exception of one ovine sample for which the G-A * value reached 2.8%. Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences ), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products.

Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences (10)..\nIn addition, the presence of 2,3-epoxy gluonic acid (epoxide) and galacturonic acid were observed and are known to be formed during the alkali treatment of heparin that occurs during the heparin purification process (24). Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures . Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra. Notably, 15 of 39 BMH samples contain galacturonic acid ranging from 0.9 to 9.8% and 4 of 39 BMH samples contain epoxide (1.3to 4.8%). These large amounts of chemically modified structures can affect not only the activity of heparin but possibly also the pharmacokinetic and other biological properties and therefore the control of epoxide and galacturonic acid process related impurities levels in the heparin API manufacturing process would be recommended.), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra.

The method developed here, is an alternative to that proposed by ANVISA, that is able not only to distinguish BMH from PMH, but also to confirm that the sample was not manufactured from other heparin sources such as bovine lung or ovine mucosa. The method, based on measurement of a proton NMR spectrum, is not much different from that present in both US and EU pharmacopeias for the identification of PMH heparin. A method utilizing the intensity ratios among selected signals was indeed already used in several pharmacopeia monographs to detect the presence of possible unknown contaminant (7). Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.. Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.\nNevertheless, overlapping signals on the proton NMR spectra prevent signals of minor structural signatures to be detected. For example, the presence of epoxidated or galacturonic acid residues cannot be easily observed in 1D proton spectra, while their signals are well resolved in the 2D HSQC spectra. The possibility to use the HSQC spectra, not only to assign 1D superimposed proton signals but also to quantify the relative abundance of each residue of glycosaminoglycans, was recently proposed by different groups (17,18). These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants. The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis .

The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis (4)..\nEven if 2D HSQC would be preferable in terms of amount of information obtained, the need for instruments equipped with high sensitivity probes (for example, cryogenically cooled probes) and for operators skilled in NMR, will make the application of the HSQC method difficult for many analytical laboratories. Although lower resolution and containing less information than 2D data sets, 1D proton-NMR data can be used to distinguish heparin types in a facile manner and is very similar to a method that is already required by several pharmacopeias and more widely applicable to an analytical laboratory. However, the increasing sensitivity and accuracy of NMR spectrometers and the availability of software which allows the complete automatization of the spectra processing and analysis have made the HSQC methodology a viable information value added alternative for many laboratories and may become more widely accessible in the future.", "file_name": "1D_and_2D_HSQC_NMR_Two_Methods_to_Distin.grobid.tei.xml"}, "hash": "b6c620e1d2c2d8e462968e5812781891c646a3007f4fb20b613b5b1acfcf86e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Title: D and 2D-HSQC NMR: Two Methods to Distinguish and Characterize Heparin From Different Animal and Tissue Sources\n\n[1. INTRODUCTION]\nHeparin, one of the world's most widely-sold polysaccharide drugs and included in the World Health Organization's \"Essential Drugs List\" (1), is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and is the anticoagulant of choice during cardio-pulmonary bypass or for hemodialysis. Until the 50's, bovine lung was the main source material for the large-scale heparin production, after which bovine lung tissue was largely replaced by porcine mucosa , is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and is the anticoagulant of choice during cardio-pulmonary bypass or for hemodialysis. Until the 50's, bovine lung was the main source material for the large-scale heparin production, after which bovine lung tissue was largely replaced by porcine mucosa (2). Subsequently, in the late 1980s there was a spike in the number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom. As a result of concerns with contamination of the heparin supply, bovine heparin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market, and currently porcine mucosa is the only source material for all heparin products approved in US and Europe . Subsequently, in the late 1980s there was a spike in the number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom. As a result of concerns with contamination of the heparin supply, bovine heparin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market, and currently porcine mucosa is the only source material for all heparin products approved in US and Europe (3)..\nFollowing the \"heparin crisis\" of 2007-2008, when at least 81 deaths and hundreds of severe anaphylactoid reactions were linked to the presence of over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) in some heparin batches, FDA and EMA initiated a rapid revision of the existing pharmacopeia monographs (4,5). In addition to including tests regarding the potency and more restrictive limits for impurities, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was introduced as an identity test. The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants .

The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants (6)..\nBecause China is responsible for roughly half of the world's pig production, about 60% of the heparin supply comes from this country. In recent years the US FDA has expressed significant interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market to mitigate the risk of supply chain issues due to the lack of source material and to diversify the source of heparin drugs globally (7). The FDA, assisted by experts coming from non-profit organizations, industries and academic institutions, is investigating the structural differences between porcine, and bovine heparins and their possible clinical implications. Previous studies extensively demonstrated structural differences between heparin from different animal and organ sources. Particularly, porcine mucosa heparin (PMH) is characterized by higher 6-O-sulfation compared to bovine mucosa heparin (BMH) (80% in PMH vs. 55% in BMH comparing the total amount of GlcNx,6S or 68% in PMH vs. 48% in BMH comparing the amount of GlcNS, 6S linked to IdoA2S) .

Despite the same animal source, bovine lung heparin (BLH) differs from BMH with higher 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation and lower content of GlcA and GlcNAc residues . Despite the same animal source, bovine lung heparin (BLH) differs from BMH with higher 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation and lower content of GlcA and GlcNAc residues (11,12). By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation . By contrast, Ovine mucosa heparin (OMH) is more similar to PMH, with the exception of slightly higher levels of sulfation in position 2 and 6 of glucosamine and in position 2 of iduronic acid and lower N-acetylation (13,14)..\nIn 2017 bovine mucosal heparin was readmitted to the market in Brazil, requiring the drafting of a new specific monograph. The NMR identification test of this new monograph includes an acceptance criterion for BMH corresponding to the ratio among the integral values of anomeric signals of glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated which is not satisfied by PMH spectra (15). In the present study an alternative method based on the measurements of the ratio between the intensity of diagnostic signals of the 1 H-NMR spectrum was proposed. The method proposed here can distinguish BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH samples from one another, while the ANVISA approach is specific for BMH vs. PMH..

The method proposed here can distinguish BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH samples from one another, while the ANVISA approach is specific for BMH vs. PMH.\nRecently, quantitative 2D-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy was established as viable method to determine the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin and LMWH (16,17). The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin . The study of the factors influencing the limit of detection, linearity, accuracy, and precision demonstrated the robustness of the method in assessing the quality of heparin (18). This method, calculating the percentage of monosaccharide and disaccharide building blocks, can distinguish the heparin source as well as identify possible structural modification of the heparin chains induced by the purification process, often undetectable in one-dimensional NMR data. The HSQC method, applied to libraries of BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH heparin batches coming from different suppliers provided a basis set of characteristics for each heparin source and of their structural variability. Phosphate buffer solution was prepared as follows: 49.7 mg of sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrate (0.36 mmol), 202.9 mg of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14 mmol), and 0.92 mg deuterated EDTA d-16 (0.003 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of water. The pH was checked at 7.1. The solution was distributed into 5 mL aliquots and then lyophilized. Each aliquot was dissolved in about 1 mL of D2O and lyophilized again. Finally, the buffer was dissolved in 5 mL of deuterium oxide with 0.002% TSP (12 mM)..

The samples included 39 porcine mucosa heparins, 39 bovine mucosa heparins, 6 ovine mucosa, and 7 from beef lung heparins. 20 BMH, 2 PMH, and 1 BLH were provided by USP, the remaining samples from Ronzoni Institute.\nAll the samples were characterized by 1 H and HSQC-NMR analysis. Table 1 summarizes the 1 H-NMR spectra recorded for this study. summarizes the 1 H-NMR spectra recorded for this study.\n\n[3. Samples Preparation]\nAbout 35 mg of heparin sample were dissolved in a 0.6 ml of phosphate buffer solution and transferred on a 5 mm NMR tube.\n\n[4. H-NMR Method]\n1 H-NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer or on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 MHz spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany), equipped with 5 mm TCI cryogenic probes. The experiments were recorded at 298 K by using the Bruker library zg pulse sequence and the following parameters: number of scans 16, dummy scans 4, relaxation delay 12 s, spectral width 16 ppm, transmitter offset 4.7 ppm. After exponential multiplication (line broadening of 0.3 Hz), the spectra were Fourier transformed, phased, baseline corrected, and calibrated on the TSP signal.\nThe spectrum can be accepted only if the following test is satisfied: the width half height of TSP is \u2264 1.4 Hz.\nThe intensity of the following signals was measured:\n-Peak 1 at 3.87 ppm that corresponds to the H5/H6 of the N-sulfated, 6-O-desulfated glucosamine (GlcNS, 6OH). -Peak 2, the highest intensity signal between 3.33 and 3.20 ppm, that corresponds to the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS,6X). -Peak 3 at 2.05 ppm that correspond to the methyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (COCH 3 ).\nThe ratio r(1:2) between peaks 1 and 2, and the ratio r(3:2) between peaks 2 and 3 were calculated and used to distinguish the different heparin sources.\n\n[5. HSQC-NMR Method]\nThe 2D-1 H, 13 C-HSQC spectra were measured on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe, using the Bruker hsqcetgpsisp2.2 pulse sequence. The spectra were recorded at 298 K using the following acquisition parameters: number of scans 12, dummy scan 16, relaxation delay 2.5 s, spectral width 8 ppm (F2), and 80 ppm (F1), transmitter offset 4.7 ppm (F2) and 80 ppm (F1), 1 J C-H = 150 Hz. 1,024 points were recorded for each of 240 increments (NUS of 75% of 320 increments). The FIDs were processed as follows: spectrum size 4096 (F2) and 1,024 (F1) (zero-filling in F2 and linear prediction in F1), squared cosine window multiplication in both dimensions and Fourier transform. The spectra were integrated using Topspin software version 3.5 (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) and the heparin composition was computed from the integral values as previously described (18)..\n\n[6. Statistical Methods]\nPrediction intervals were computed assuming normal distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests gave p > 0.3) of the data, using the formula: where x and sd are the mean and the standard deviation of the n observations, and \u03c4 0.995,n-1 is the 0.995th quantile of the Student's t-distribution with n -1 degrees of freedom. Boxplot were produced as follows: the lower and upper limits of the box correspond to the 25th and the 75th percentiles. Called IQR the distance between these two limits, the ends of the boxplot vertical segments correspond to the lowest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the percentile, and the highest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the 75th percentile. Data outside of the vertical segments were plotted as dots.\n\n[7. RESULTS]\nProton NMR spectra of heparin show slightly different profiles according the animal/organ origin (Figure 1). Of the types tested here, proton NMR spectra of BMH have the most observable differences compared to other heparins. Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies ). Of the types tested here, proton NMR spectra of BMH have the most observable differences compared to other heparins. Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies (8,19). The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.. The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.\nThe idea to integrate diagnostic signals of carbon and proton NMR spectra to distinguish bovine and porcine heparin was first proposed by Casu et al. (8) and then by Tovar et al.  and then by Tovar et al. (20) and Fu et al.  and Fu et al. (14). The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil . The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil (15), uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively. However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure , uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively. However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure 2), we decided to use different signals which had less interference from other monosaccharides. As reference signals we chose the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) and the acetyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) which have chemical shift values of 3.28 and 2.04 ppm, respectively, and are well separated from the other signals (annotated peaks 2 and 3 of Figure ), we decided to use different signals which had less interference from other monosaccharides. As reference signals we chose the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) and the acetyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) which have chemical shift values of 3.28 and 2.04 ppm, respectively, and are well separated from the other signals (annotated peaks 2 and 3 of Figure 1). For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure ). For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure 1). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure ). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure 2).).\nThe integral values of partially overlapped heparin signals can vary as a function of the magnetic field used, spectral resolution or by the natural structural variability of heparin (22). Moreover, the ANVISA method was designed to distinguish BMH from PMH, while the method discussed here aims to differentiate PMH, BMH, OMH, and BLH. For this reason, we evaluated the signal intensities instead of the integral values. Due to the polyelectrolyte characteristic of heparin, slight differences in the concentration, pH or ionic strength of the heparin solutions can induce small changes in chemical shift values.

Due to the polyelectrolyte characteristic of heparin, slight differences in the concentration, pH or ionic strength of the heparin solutions can induce small changes in chemical shift values. Figure 3 shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer. The addition of buffer removes the small shifts observed in deuterium oxide, making the spectra more reproducible, and comparable by minimizing pH and ionic strength sources of variation. Moreover, to avoid variation of signal intensities due to bad spectral resolution from poor field homogeneity, a requirement of a minimum full width at half-height linewidth of the signal of deuterated trimethylsilylpropionic acid sodium salt (TSP), used as chemical shift reference, was introduced (see the Experimental Section). shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer.

The intensities of peaks 1 (3.87 ppm), 2 (3.28 ppm),  and 3 (2.05 ppm) were measured and the ratios 1:2 and 3:2 were calculated (Supplementary Tables 123456). Results, shown in Figure ). Results, shown in Figure 4, indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure , indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure 5 can be used to identify heparin types from each group from these ratios: first check the 1:2 ratio is between 1.21 and 1.88, to classify the sample as BMH, otherwise check the 3:2 ratio to decide among PMH, OMH, BLH, or an unknown source. The limits of Figure  can be used to identify heparin types from each group from these ratios: first check the 1:2 ratio is between 1.21 and 1.88, to classify the sample as BMH, otherwise check the 3:2 ratio to decide among PMH, OMH, BLH, or an unknown source. The limits of Figure 5 correspond to prediction intervals with 99% probability (see Experimental section). The PMH and OMH interval separation was the smallest, confirming the similarity of heparins from these two sources. The results were only marginally affected by the magnetic field strength (500 or 600 MHz) so the scheme can be adopted independently of the instrument used. correspond to prediction intervals with 99% probability (see Experimental section).

The results were only marginally affected by the magnetic field strength (500 or 600 MHz) so the scheme can be adopted independently of the instrument used.\nA repeatability study was performed using a PMH heparin batch to determine the precision of the method. Six NMR tubes of the same sample were prepared, and proton spectra were recorded on each sample using 16 or 8 scans, respectively. Results summarized in the Supplementary Table 7 show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans. show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans.\nA series of 20 BMH, 1 PMH, and 1 BLH provided by USP were analyzed by 1 H-NMR by two independent laboratories. Results obtained on BMH show a good comparability between the ranges and values obtained by the two laboratories (Table 2 and Supplementary Table  and Supplementary Table 8). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45. Both laboratories identified test samples (BLH and PMH) as non-compatible with BMH [r(1:2) \u2264 1]. However, while the BLH sample was correctly identified by both laboratories, laboratory 2 identified the PMH sample as OMH, since r(3:2) value (1.37) was within the range of mucosa ovine heparin. A more detailed analysis of the spectra reveals a lower spectral resolution of the PMH spectrum measured by laboratory 2, confirmed by the different width at half height of TSP between the two spectra (about 1 Hz and 5 Hz, for laboratory 1 and 2, respectively) (Figures ). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45. Both laboratories identified test samples (BLH and PMH) as non-compatible with BMH [r(1:2) \u2264 1]. However, while the BLH sample was correctly identified by both laboratories, laboratory 2 identified the PMH sample as OMH, since r(3:2) value (1.37) was within the range of mucosa ovine heparin. A more detailed analysis of the spectra reveals a lower spectral resolution of the PMH spectrum measured by laboratory 2, confirmed by the different width at half height of TSP between the two spectra (about 1 Hz and 5 Hz, for laboratory 1 and 2, respectively) (Figures 6A,B). The r(3:2) ratio value obtained from the spectrum measured by laboratory 2 on the same sample, comply with the resolution requirement (width at half height of TSP of 1.4 Hz), was 2.15, therefore compatible with PMH sample (Figures ). The r(3:2) ratio value obtained from the spectrum measured by laboratory 2 on the same sample, comply with the resolution requirement (width at half height of TSP of 1.4 Hz), was 2.15, therefore compatible with PMH sample (Figures 5,6C). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.\n\n[9. HSQC Analysis]\nQuantitative HSQC was recently applied to heparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for calculating the percentage of monosaccharides and disaccharides by normalizing volumes with reference to the sum of volumes of signals corresponding to each monosaccharide type (glucosamines or uronic acids) and the same carbon proton pair type (17,18). This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources . This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources (10).  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables .  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables 9101112131415161718192021) and summarized in the box plots of Figure ) and summarized in the box plots of Figure 7. Notably, the monosaccharide composition of both glucosamine and uronic acid shows some variability within the same heparin source that is attributed to the natural variability of the starting material and to the different process conditions used by manufacturers to purify heparin from the crudes. However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure . Notably, the monosaccharide composition of both glucosamine and uronic acid shows some variability within the same heparin source that is attributed to the natural variability of the starting material and to the different process conditions used by manufacturers to purify heparin from the crudes. However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure 7). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods ). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods (8)..\nImportantly, differences which were not observable in the 1D proton spectra were clearly detected by the HSQC method. For instance, OMH, PMH, and BLH differ not only in the degree of acetylation of glucosamine residues (PMH>OMH>BLH) but also in the glucuronic acid content and non-sulfated iduronic acid content (PMH>OMH>BLH) (Figure 7). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.\nA further level of characterization involved the quantification of disaccharide sequences and minor features, such as the heparin biological activity related glucuronic acid linked to 3-Osulfated glucosamine (G-A * ) disaccharide that is a marker of the antithrombin-binding (ATb) pentasaccharide (23)..\nBecause the G-A * sequence was identified exclusively in the active pentasaccharide sequence, G-A * can be considered the marker of the heparin ATb site. The amount of G-A * has a certain variability within each heparin source (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources. In particular, the highest amount of G-A * was observed in the PMH samples (from 1.9 to 3.4%), while in the other species G-A * was always lower than 1.0 %, with the exception of one ovine sample for which the G-A * value reached 2.8%. Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences ), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources. In particular, the highest amount of G-A * was observed in the PMH samples (from 1.9 to 3.4%), while in the other species G-A * was always lower than 1.0 %, with the exception of one ovine sample for which the G-A * value reached 2.8%. Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences (10)..\nIn addition, the presence of 2,3-epoxy gluonic acid (epoxide) and galacturonic acid were observed and are known to be formed during the alkali treatment of heparin that occurs during the heparin purification process (24). Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures . Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra. Notably, 15 of 39 BMH samples contain galacturonic acid ranging from 0.9 to 9.8% and 4 of 39 BMH samples contain epoxide (1.3to 4.8%). These large amounts of chemically modified structures can affect not only the activity of heparin but possibly also the pharmacokinetic and other biological properties and therefore the control of epoxide and galacturonic acid process related impurities levels in the heparin API manufacturing process would be recommended.), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra.

CONCLUSION]\nIn response to the FDA interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market, there is a need to develop tests for the identity of the heparin animal and tissue origin. The method developed here, is an alternative to that proposed by ANVISA, that is able not only to distinguish BMH from PMH, but also to confirm that the sample was not manufactured from other heparin sources such as bovine lung or ovine mucosa. The method, based on measurement of a proton NMR spectrum, is not much different from that present in both US and EU pharmacopeias for the identification of PMH heparin. A method utilizing the intensity ratios among selected signals was indeed already used in several pharmacopeia monographs to detect the presence of possible unknown contaminant (7). Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.. Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.\nNevertheless, overlapping signals on the proton NMR spectra prevent signals of minor structural signatures to be detected. For example, the presence of epoxidated or galacturonic acid residues cannot be easily observed in 1D proton spectra, while their signals are well resolved in the 2D HSQC spectra. The possibility to use the HSQC spectra, not only to assign 1D superimposed proton signals but also to quantify the relative abundance of each residue of glycosaminoglycans, was recently proposed by different groups (17,18). These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants. The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis . These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants. The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis (4)..\nEven if 2D HSQC would be preferable in terms of amount of information obtained, the need for instruments equipped with high sensitivity probes (for example, cryogenically cooled probes) and for operators skilled in NMR, will make the application of the HSQC method difficult for many analytical laboratories. Although lower resolution and containing less information than 2D data sets, 1D proton-NMR data can be used to distinguish heparin types in a facile manner and is very similar to a method that is already required by several pharmacopeias and more widely applicable to an analytical laboratory. However, the increasing sensitivity and accuracy of NMR spectrometers and the availability of software which allows the complete automatization of the spectra processing and analysis have made the HSQC methodology a viable information value added alternative for many laboratories and may become more widely accessible in the future.\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 35052, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b0cef4a-9e45-4356-ba06-bc0d39405855": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b0cef4a-9e45-4356-ba06-bc0d39405855", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "H NMR studies of molecular interaction of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-Dglucosamine with capsaicin in aqueous and non-aqueous media", "authors": ["Inocencio Higuera-Ciapara", "Claudia Viru\u00e9s", "Marcela Jim\u00e9nez-Ch\u00e1vez", "Evelin Mart\u00ednez-Benavidez", "Javier Hern\u00e1ndez", "Zaira Dom\u00ednguez", "Roberto L\u00f3pez-Rend\u00f3n", "Enrique F Vel\u00e1zquez", "Motomichi Inoue", "Evelin Mart\u00ednez- Benavidez"], "Introduction": "Capsaicin, N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methyl-trans-6-nonenamide, is the major capsaicinoid of chili peppers (Capsicum spp.).

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na\u2082CO\u2082 and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22].

The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

The pKa of capsaicin has been reported to be 9.76 and 9.93 [33,34]. Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit . Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55.

The total concentrations of the isomers, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl , were obtained on the basis of the populations determined from the NMR signal intensities. Equations 13 and 14 can be expressed by a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , individually, as explained in Section 5.2 (Calculation models and processes). Least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 have determined the formation constants shown in Table 3.

Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ).

The absolute C values tend to be larger in the \u03b1-complex than in the \u03b2-complex;\nthe former may be in a closer contact in consistency with the larger K f\u03b1 values. In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin.

Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups.

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD.

The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.\nSince the oxygen atoms are bound in an irregular manner, Equation 2 is invalid for the OH proton shifts, as the asymptotic titration curves of OH protons show a trend of saturation in a high concentration range as compared with the curve of NH 3 + (Figure 1).).\nThe broken lines in Figure 3  for n = 2.

Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55.

The total concentrations of the isomers, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl , were obtained on the basis of the populations determined from the NMR signal intensities. Equations 13 and 14 can be expressed by a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , individually, as explained in Section 5.2 (Calculation models and processes).

The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ).

The absolute C values tend to be larger in the \u03b1-complex than in the \u03b2-complex;\nthe former may be in a closer contact in consistency with the larger K f\u03b1 values. In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin.

Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups.

The molecule (shown in Scheme 1) consists of a hydrophilic unit (region A composed of a vanillyl ring) and a hydrophobic unit (region C composed of a fatty acid), which are linked by an amide linkage (region B), conferring amphipathic characters on the compound; every region is expected to contribute to the biological activities [1,2].

Recently, chitosan-capsaicin complexes have been subjected to evaluation of physicochemical and biological activities [11,16]. Despite the notable properties of chitosan towards capsaicin, it is hard to have an insight into the functions at chemical and molecular levers because of the complex glucosamineacetylglucosamine network. The complexation of chitosan is supposed to proceed in a complicated process involving collective polymer effects in addition to intermolecular interaction of component monomer units.

Experimental]\nCapsaicin (\u2265 95%), D-glucosamine hydrochloride (\u2265 99 %) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (\u2265 95 %) were supplied from Aldrich, and were confirmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR. All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na\u2082CO\u2082 and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22]. The variation of pD was less than \u00b10.02 in every titration run. Volume changes due to addition of aliquots were corrected in calculation process.

Self-association of glucosamine cation]\nThe 1 H NMR spectrum of glucosamine hydrochloride presents only the signals of \u03b1 form in DMSO. The chemical shifts \u03b4 are changed with the concentration, as represented in Figure 1 for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure  for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials section). The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations in Supplementary Materials section). The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes). The parameters are determined as K as = 490 (230) M -1 , \u03b4 ua = 7.750 (0.041) and \u03b4 as = 8.067 (0.008); the numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations, and M = mol dm -3 . Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes). The parameters are determined as K as = 490 (230) M -1 , \u03b4 ua = 7.750 (0.041) and \u03b4 as = 8.067 (0.008); the numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations, and M = mol dm -3 . Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .\nFurthermore, K as determined for different sample solutions are varied in the same order of the standard deviation, because the hydrogen bonds are readily broken by water involved\nunavoidably in the solvent [24,25]; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.\nSince the oxygen atoms are bound in an irregular manner, Equation 2 is invalid for the OH proton shifts, as the asymptotic titration curves of OH protons show a trend of saturation in a high concentration range as compared with the curve of NH 3 + (Figure 1).).\nThe broken lines in Figure 3  for n = 2.

Complexation of glucosamine with capsaicin]\nComplexation with capsaicin has been studied for GlH + and Gl 0 species individually by selecting pD values in titrations: i.e., pD = 6.55 at which the mole fraction of GlH + is 0.98; pD = 9.55 at which the mole fraction of Gl 0 is 0.93. The pKa of capsaicin has been reported to be 9.76 and 9.93 [33,34]. Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit . Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55. Therefore, a titration at the selected pD gives practically the proper formation constant for each species At pD 9.55, the 1 H NMR signals of the CH(2) and CH(1) protons in both glucosamine isomers show significant shifts upon addition of capsaicin, as represented in Figure , capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55. Therefore, a titration at the selected pD gives practically the proper formation constant for each species At pD 9.55, the 1 H NMR signals of the CH(2) and CH(1) protons in both glucosamine isomers show significant shifts upon addition of capsaicin, as represented in Figure 10 and   and  S3 in Supplementary Materials). in Supplementary Materials).\nThe titration curves in Figure 11 show asymptotic decrease which is characteristic of 1:1complexation. Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually: show asymptotic decrease which is characteristic of 1:1complexation. Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually:\nIn these expressions, [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] and [\u03b2Gl 0 Cp] are the molar concentrations of capsaicin complexes with \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , respectively. In the fast exchange case, of each isomer is proportional to the mole fraction of the complex.\nHere jC\u03b1 and jC\u03b2 are the j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 values inherent in the signal j of the complexes of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms, respectively. The total concentrations of the isomers, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl , were obtained on the basis of the populations determined from the NMR signal intensities. Equations 13 and 14 can be expressed by a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , individually, as explained in Section 5.2 (Calculation models and processes). Least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 have determined the formation constants shown in Table 3. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.\nIn the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine at pD 9.55, the aromatic protons shift upfield with line-broadening, as presented in Figure 12, while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table , while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table S4 in Supplementary Materials). The changes in \u03b4 of the aromatic protons are plotted in Figure  in Supplementary Materials). The changes in \u03b4 of the aromatic protons are plotted in Figure 13. Complexed capsaicin exhibits proton signals averaged over the complexes of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, due to the fast exchange. As a consequence, K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 cannot be determined individually from the observed monotonic titration curves. The solid lines in Figure .

The solid lines in Figure 13 are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table  are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table 3 give underestimation for the true formation constant, due to the hydrogen bonds in the complex with glucosamine. Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction  give underestimation for the true formation constant, due to the hydrogen bonds in the complex with glucosamine. Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field . Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field [24,38,39]. The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table . The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure 14). Change in \u03b4 of other protons are less than 0.0035 in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers (cf. Table ). Change in \u03b4 of other protons are less than 0.0035 in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers (cf.

The absolute C values tend to be larger in the \u03b1-complex than in the \u03b2-complex;\nthe former may be in a closer contact in consistency with the larger K f\u03b1 values. In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

Complexation of N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin]\nThe complexation of N-acetylglucosamine was studied at pD 9.55 for comparison with glucosamine, although the former is not protonated in the ordinary pH range [40]; at pD 6.55, the solubility of capsaicin was too low for titrations. In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure ). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure S6 in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table  in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table S3). A novel phenomena found in the titration is that the populations of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms are changed in the presence of capsaicin: \u03b1 form is the majority with a population of 0.66 until the concentration This observation suggests indirectly the presence of hyperconjugative interactions operative at the anomeric carbon, although the interaction is too weak to form a complex with a definite composition. In summary, capsaicin has much stronger molecular interaction with deprotonated glucosamine than with the N-acetyl derivative.).

Protonation of glucosamine]\nGlucosamine is in protonation-deprotonation equilibrium with a logarithmic protonation constant (equivalent to pKa) of 7.58 [29]. Since a common weak acid is dissociated in D 2 O at a pD higher than at the corresponding pH in H 2 O by ca. one unit . Since a common weak acid is dissociated in D 2 O at a pD higher than at the corresponding pH in H 2 O by ca. one unit [30,31], the protonation constant and the species distribution of glucosamine in D 2 O are required to be determined prior to NMR studies of complexation. Figure , the protonation constant and the species distribution of glucosamine in D 2 O are required to be determined prior to NMR studies of complexation. Figure 8 represents \u03b4 versus pD plots obtained for CH(1) and CH  represents \u03b4 versus pD plots obtained for CH(1) and CH (2) protons, which exhibit the most significant shifts in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms. For a single-step protonation, \u03b4 j of proton j is expressed by the following function of pD. protons, which exhibit the most significant shifts in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms. For a single-step protonation, \u03b4 j of proton j is expressed by the following function of pD.\nHere \u03b4 j0 and \u03b4 j1 are the \u03b4 j inherent in the deprotonated species (denoted by Gl 0 ) and that of the mono-protonated species (denoted by GlH + ), respectively, and K D is the protonation constant in expected to be more stable in \u03b1 form, enabling protonation at the higher pD. This distinction is supposed to be caused by the steric and stereoelectronic effects of the anomeric carbon [32]..\nThe to environment that may be altered with pD. The reversible conversion from A to B with increasing pD is defined by:\nHere [Gl 0 A ] and [Gl 0 B ] are the molar concentrations of Gl 0 under the influence of environments A and B, respectively. When the pD response of the interconversion is expressed by the logistic (or \"dose-response\") equation against pD, the population P of either form can be expressed by an extended formula of Equation 8 as follows.\nHere P 0B , P 0A , and P 1 are the populations intrinsic of Gl 0 B , Gl 0 A , and GlH + species, respectively, in either isomer, and K \u2032 D is an apparent protonation constant related to the population change.\n\n[8. M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D]\nIn the titrations at pD 6.55, at which glucosamine is fully protonated, the \u03b4 changes of capsaicin protons are much smaller than those at pD 9.55 (cf. Table S4). The largest change is observed for CH(2) protons for both isomers. Even their titration curves do not show asymptotic trends, which are difficult to interpret definitely (Figure ). The largest change is observed for CH(2) protons for both isomers. Even their titration curves do not show asymptotic trends, which are difficult to interpret definitely (Figure S5 in Supplementary Materials). in Supplementary Materials).\nTentative least-squares calculations based on the competitive complexation have estimated the formation constant to be of the order of 10 M -1 . Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .\n\n[9. Conclusion]\nProtonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups. This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.

This is another evidence for the role of NH 2 in the complexation of glucosamine.\nThe above complexation schemes in aqueous media are suggestive of local interaction sites in nanocarriers based on chitosan, which is composed of glucosamine and Nacetylglucosamine (Scheme 1). The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin. This selective interaction is much more pronounced in basic media in which glucosamine is not protonated.\n\n[10. Self-association in DMSO]\nThis section explains the calculation model and process of \u03b4 given by Equation 2for selfassociation. The mass balance of the self-association is expressed by the following equation.for selfassociation. The mass balance of the self-association is expressed by the following equation.\nHere C Gl is the total molar concentration of glucosamine, and the summation is made from 2 to n depending on the degree of association. The summation of the geometric progression leads to the polynomial of x that is K as [Gl]:\nx -(n + 1)\nThe numerical solution of the polynomial gives x for a certain n, and hence [Gl] can be calculated for a given K as . Equation 2for \u03b4 is rewritten by:for \u03b4 is rewritten by:\nThe second term is replaced by C Gl -[Gl], and the third term is rewritten by a geometric progression as follows.\nThe summation of the geometrical progression to n leads to the following equation.\nSince [Gl] is obtained numerically from Equation 16for given K as values, \u03b4 is expressed as a function of K as by a series of numerical calculations. Least-squares fitting of an observed \u03b4 versus C Gl curve determines the association constant K as together with \u03b4 ua and \u03b4 as .

Competitive complexation in D 2 O]\nThis section explains the least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 defined by Equations 13 and 14 for the competitive complexation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers.\nThe concentrations in Equations 11 and 12 follow the mass balances expressed by:\nIn these expressions, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl are the total molar concentrations of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, respectively. Combination of Equations 11 and 12 with Equations 20-22 leads to the following cubic equation of X that is [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] for \u03b1 form.\n(\nHere\nThe same type of cubic equation is derived for \u03b2 form by interchanging subscripts \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the parameters. The cubic equations can be solved numerically for given K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 . A series of solutions gives [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] as a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , and leads to a pair of theoretical titration curves of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 against C Cp on the basis of Equations 13 and 14. Alternate curve fittings were carried out repeatedly on a pair of titration curves of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms as follows. The first least-squares calculation was executed for j\u03b1 by assuming K f\u03b2 = 0; the resulting K f\u03b1 is the formation constant for virtual non-competitive complexation. This value was employed for K f\u03b1 in the least-squares fitting of j\u03b2 , and the obtained K f\u03b2 was used in the next least-squares fitting of j\u03b1 . These alternate fittings were repeated until convergence in the parameters. The consistency was confirmed by changing the order of least-squares calculations for j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 .

This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms [3,[7][8][9]. Binding of an individual lectin to a monosaccharide substrate is extremely weak; the dissociation constants (K d ) for these complexes are typically in the 0.1-10 mM range. This is largely due to the solvent-exposed nature of the lectin binding sites, which make few direct contacts with monosaccharide substrate.

This molecule can bind selectively all-equatorial disaccharides such as cellobiose in water within the range of values reported for lectins. As in previously mentioned examples, hydrophobic attractions supported by CH-interactions are the driving forces for the binding of disaccharides.

Boronic acid is known to react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of carbohydrates to form five or six-membered cyclic esters in basic aqueous media.

Our synthetic receptors are relatively small, have the desired threedimensional structure, hydrogen-bonding site and lipophilic binding pocket to promote hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.", "RECEPTOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES": "Macrocyclic structures are particularly useful for design of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules mainly because they are large enough to contain a spherical binding site (lipophylic cavity) of appropriate size and shape. Incorporation of condensed polypyridine units into such macrocyclic structure could result in construction of artificial receptors capable of selective carbohydrate binding in water through combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, condensed polypyridine compounds exhibit strong absorption and fluorescence emission bands, and complexation induced changes in their absorption or fluorescence spectra will allow for the determination of the stability constants.\nTo demonstrate the suitability of macrocyclic polypyridine structures for design of artificial receptors capable of binding carbohydrate substrates in water, we synthesized three types of 1,8naphthyridine based receptor molecules 1-3, Fig. (1)..\n1,8-Naphthyridine moiety has been successfully used in design of receptors for monosaccharide binding in organic solvents [12e,f], and there is strong literature evidence demonstrating that replacement of pyridine or pyrimidine with naphthyridine core moiety in some acyclic carbohydrate receptors resulted in a significant enhancement of the receptor's binding properties [12f]. However, this monosaccharide binding motif remains largely unexploited in the design and synthesis of receptors for binding and recognition of these important biological substrates in water. Synthesized bibracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic receptor 3 possess a 1,8-naphthyridine core moiety bridged with two flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amines (TREN). In these receptors, two adjacent pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as the proton acceptors (AA), while lateral TREN secondary amines function as the proton donors (DD). The relay of hydroxyl groups in monosaccharides offers an ADDA motif complementary to the DAAD array of naphthyridine receptors to form multiple H-bonds [13].

Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells [15], we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies. The pK a values obtained for aromatic, terti- ary, secondary and primary nitrogens of receptor 2 were 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, and 10.7, respectively. In the case of UV/vis experiments, lowering the pH of the receptor 2 solution from 11 to 8 caused a decrease of the absorption intensity at 315 nm, while further lowering the pH of the solution from 8 to 1 resulted in the opposite effect. In this case, the absorption intensity increased with a bathochromic shift of the maximum wavelength ( max =319 nm, pH 1), associated with the formation of an isosbestic point at 274 nm. Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds , we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies.

Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds [16] indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39)  indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39) [17]. Based on these experiments, we can assume that at pH 6.5 in receptors 1-3 only lateral TREN primary and secondary amines will be protonated, allowing desired DAAD H-bonding arrangement for optimal interactions with monosaccharide substrates. The repulsive interactions between positively charged TREN bridges may be expected to prevent complete self-stacking of 1,8-naphthiridine units in both receptors 2 and 3 thus creating a hydrophobic binding pocket. Although the TREN bridges in both macrocyclic receptors are flexible enough to allow the binding pocket to adjust to carbohydrate substrate for optimal interactions, a greater degree of structural flexibility and conformational adaptability may be expected for the receptor 2. Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions..

As expected, comparison of the UV/vis spectra of reference compound 1 and receptors 2 and 3 taken in an aqueous buffer (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c buffer = 0.05 M, c 1 = 2 10 -4 M, max 1= 312 nm, 1 = 4725.7 M -1 cm -1 , c 2 = 10 -4 M, max 2= 315 nm, 2 = 7372.5 M -1 cm -1 , c 3 = 6.7 10 -5 , max 3= 316 nm, 3 = 13713.0 M -1 cm -1 ), shows a hypochromicity ( 3 <3 1, 2 <2 1 ), an absorption band broadening and bathochromic shift for 2 and 3. Observed effects are indicative of the presence of weak intramolecular -stacking interactions between the 1,8naphthyridine units; strong stacking interactions are reported to produce more pronounced hypochromicity and bathochromic shift [16a,c]. In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M.\nIn contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2). An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer . An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table ). All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table 1, receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution. Affinities toward neutral substrates are much lower and thus not determinable by fluorescence or UV/vis titration experiments under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharides mainly through charge-charge interactions and that hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions play a negligible role or no role in the complex stabilization. In support of this, no significant differences in affinities of receptor 3 toward negatively charged substrates was observed. Obtained results can be explained by the lack of flexible 2-aminoethyl \"arms\" in receptor 3 and somewhat more sterically hindered binding pocket so that complete substrate encapsulation cannot occur. On the other hand, the conformationally more flexible receptor 2 showed millimolar affinities toward neutral hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose, as well as negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and sialic acid.

These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.\nIn order to examine the role of hydrogen bonds in stabilization of the complexes, various neutral pyranose and deoxy-pyranose   substrates were investigated. Among these substrates, receptor 2 shows binding preferences for glucose over deoxy-glucose substrates (Table 1) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose. As in previous cases, the stability constants for these complexes also were not determinable by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration experiments. This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability.

We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5). Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.. Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.\nA similar trend in fluorescence intensity was observed for the titration of 3 with negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. An extensive literature search resulted in only one example of artificial receptors capable of discriminating between closely related monosaccharides in aqueous solutions. Cu(II)-coordinated glucose-imprinted poly(acrilate) receptor, reported by S. Striegler [21], has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation , has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation [18] can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities.\nThe observed 1:1 stoichiometry for complexes of 2 and 3 with monosaccharide substrates and the fact that the stability constants for 1 are very low and thus not determinable by UV/vis or fluorescence titrations indicate that complexation occurs by insertion of the substrate molecule into each receptor's lipophilic pocket. Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6). The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. .

The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis. Also, due to lower sensitivity of the NMR experiment, higher mM concentrations of receptor 2 and sialic acid had to be used.

The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes .

This process mediates many important aspects of cell-cell recognition, such as inflammation, cell differentiation, tumor cell colonization and metastasis. In addition, the carbohydrate structures, which decorate the cell surface of higher organisms, change with the onset of cancer and inflammation, representing highly promising targets for new and more-selective anticancer drugs and for early diagnosis. However, due to its complexity and weak binding affinities, carbohydrate recognition by natural systems is still poorly understood. On the other hand, studies of synthetic carbohydrate receptors could make significant contributions to a better understanding of this process and lead to the development of new chemotherapeutics and chemosensors.

Given the importance of the carbohydrate recognition process, it is not surprising that design and synthesis of artificial receptors for these important biological substrates has attracted a great deal of attention in biomimetic and supramolecular chemistry.\nFor example, artificial receptors that can selectively bind sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), a monosaccharide that is typically found at the termini of some cancer cell specific antigens (e.g., sialyl Lewis x and sialyl Lewis a), may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents that would have broad applicability to a variety of cancers [1b]..\nCurrent efforts are mainly focused on design of the receptors for complexation of mono-or disaccharides [2]. This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms . This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms [3,[7][8][9]. Binding of an individual lectin to a monosaccharide substrate is extremely weak; the dissociation constants (K d ) for these complexes are typically in the 0.1-10 mM range. This is largely due to the solvent-exposed nature of the lectin binding sites, which make few direct contacts with monosaccharide substrate.

A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak. One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules , the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages. A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak. One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules [5]. These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin . These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin [6], calixarene , calixarene [7], porphyrin , porphyrin [8] or cage-type molecules  or cage-type molecules [9] showed that it is possible to design and synthesize artificial receptors for binding carbohydrates in water, although stabilities of their complexes are weak. These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P.

These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P. Davis et al. represents another interesting approach in the design of artificial carbohydrate receptors [10]. This molecule can bind selectively all-equatorial disaccharides such as cellobiose in water within the range of values reported for lectins. As in previously mentioned examples, hydrophobic attractions supported by CH-interactions are the driving forces for the binding of disaccharides. In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation .

In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation [2b, 11]. Boronic acid is known to react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of carbohydrates to form five or six-membered cyclic esters in basic aqueous media. However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation.

Our synthetic receptors are relatively small, have the desired threedimensional structure, hydrogen-bonding site and lipophilic binding pocket to promote hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.", "RECEPTOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES": "Macrocyclic structures are particularly useful for design of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules mainly because they are large enough to contain a spherical binding site (lipophylic cavity) of appropriate size and shape. Incorporation of condensed polypyridine units into such macrocyclic structure could result in construction of artificial receptors capable of selective carbohydrate binding in water through combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, condensed polypyridine compounds exhibit strong absorption and fluorescence emission bands, and complexation induced changes in their absorption or fluorescence spectra will allow for the determination of the stability constants.\nTo demonstrate the suitability of macrocyclic polypyridine structures for design of artificial receptors capable of binding carbohydrate substrates in water, we synthesized three types of 1,8naphthyridine based receptor molecules 1-3, Fig. (1)..\n1,8-Naphthyridine moiety has been successfully used in design of receptors for monosaccharide binding in organic solvents [12e,f], and there is strong literature evidence demonstrating that replacement of pyridine or pyrimidine with naphthyridine core moiety in some acyclic carbohydrate receptors resulted in a significant enhancement of the receptor's binding properties [12f]. However, this monosaccharide binding motif remains largely unexploited in the design and synthesis of receptors for binding and recognition of these important biological substrates in water. Synthesized bibracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic receptor 3 possess a 1,8-naphthyridine core moiety bridged with two flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amines (TREN). In these receptors, two adjacent pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as the proton acceptors (AA), while lateral TREN secondary amines function as the proton donors (DD). The relay of hydroxyl groups in monosaccharides offers an ADDA motif complementary to the DAAD array of naphthyridine receptors to form multiple H-bonds [13]. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.", "SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECEPTORS 1-3": "1,8-Naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4, a key receptor intermediate, was synthesized over five steps as previously reported [14]. Condensation of 1,8-naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4 with an equimolar amount of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) followed by treatment with NaBH 4 yields a mixture of receptors 2 (30%) and 3 (15%), Scheme 1. However, if the 2:3 ratio of 4 and TREN is used, the major product formed is receptor 3 (45%) while 2 cannot be detected. In both cases pure 2 and 3 were obtained after RP-HPLC purification of crude reaction mixtures. Compound 1 was prepared for control studies by condensation of 4 with two equivalents of propylamine using the same synthetic strategy. After solvent evaporation, the oily residue was redissolved in water containing 0.1 % TFA, and the final product 1 was purified by RP-HPLC. The product 1 was obtained in 60% yield.

Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells [15], we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies. The pK a values obtained for aromatic, terti- ary, secondary and primary nitrogens of receptor 2 were 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, and 10.7, respectively. In the case of UV/vis experiments, lowering the pH of the receptor 2 solution from 11 to 8 caused a decrease of the absorption intensity at 315 nm, while further lowering the pH of the solution from 8 to 1 resulted in the opposite effect. In this case, the absorption intensity increased with a bathochromic shift of the maximum wavelength ( max =319 nm, pH 1), associated with the formation of an isosbestic point at 274 nm. Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds , we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5.

Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds [16] indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39)  indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39) [17]. Based on these experiments, we can assume that at pH 6.5 in receptors 1-3 only lateral TREN primary and secondary amines will be protonated, allowing desired DAAD H-bonding arrangement for optimal interactions with monosaccharide substrates. The repulsive interactions between positively charged TREN bridges may be expected to prevent complete self-stacking of 1,8-naphthiridine units in both receptors 2 and 3 thus creating a hydrophobic binding pocket. Although the TREN bridges in both macrocyclic receptors are flexible enough to allow the binding pocket to adjust to carbohydrate substrate for optimal interactions, a greater degree of structural flexibility and conformational adaptability may be expected for the receptor 2. Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions..

As expected, comparison of the UV/vis spectra of reference compound 1 and receptors 2 and 3 taken in an aqueous buffer (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c buffer = 0.05 M, c 1 = 2 10 -4 M, max 1= 312 nm, 1 = 4725.7 M -1 cm -1 , c 2 = 10 -4 M, max 2= 315 nm, 2 = 7372.5 M -1 cm -1 , c 3 = 6.7 10 -5 , max 3= 316 nm, 3 = 13713.0 M -1 cm -1 ), shows a hypochromicity ( 3 <3 1, 2 <2 1 ), an absorption band broadening and bathochromic shift for 2 and 3. Observed effects are indicative of the presence of weak intramolecular -stacking interactions between the 1,8naphthyridine units; strong stacking interactions are reported to produce more pronounced hypochromicity and bathochromic shift [16a,c]. In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M.\nIn contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2). An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer . An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

The binding affinities of receptors 1-3 toward a variety of monosaccharide substrates were examined by UV/vis, and fluorometric titration experiments in cacodylate buffer (0.05 M) at pH 6.5, and room temperature, Fig. 3 (A) and and(C). In all experiments the concentration of receptor was kept constant (c 2 =10 -4 M, c 3 =6 10 -5 M for UV/vis, and c 2 =10 -6 M, c 3 =2 10 -6 M for fluorimetric titrations), whereas the concentration of carbohydrate substrates was varied from cca 10 -5 -4 10 -2 M in the case of UV/vis and cca 10 -5 -10 -3 M in the case of fluorimetric titration experiments.

All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table ). All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table 1, receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution. Affinities toward neutral substrates are much lower and thus not determinable by fluorescence or UV/vis titration experiments under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharides mainly through charge-charge interactions and that hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions play a negligible role or no role in the complex stabilization. In support of this, no significant differences in affinities of receptor 3 toward negatively charged substrates was observed. Obtained results can be explained by the lack of flexible 2-aminoethyl \"arms\" in receptor 3 and somewhat more sterically hindered binding pocket so that complete substrate encapsulation cannot occur. On the other hand, the conformationally more flexible receptor 2 showed millimolar affinities toward neutral hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose, as well as negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and sialic acid. However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table , receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution.

However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table 1), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.\nIn order to examine the role of hydrogen bonds in stabilization of the complexes, various neutral pyranose and deoxy-pyranose   substrates were investigated. Among these substrates, receptor 2 shows binding preferences for glucose over deoxy-glucose substrates (Table 1) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose. As in previous cases, the stability constants for these complexes also were not determinable by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration experiments. This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability.

This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.\nIn the case of two bigger disaccharide substrates, D-trehalose and D-gentiobiose (both composed of two glucose units), the K d values determined for receptor 2 are comparable to those of glucose, suggesting that only one glucose unit of these disaccharides participate in the binding. We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5). Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.. Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.\nA similar trend in fluorescence intensity was observed for the titration of 3 with negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. An extensive literature search resulted in only one example of artificial receptors capable of discriminating between closely related monosaccharides in aqueous solutions. Cu(II)-coordinated glucose-imprinted poly(acrilate) receptor, reported by S. Striegler [21], has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation , has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation [18] can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities.\nThe observed 1:1 stoichiometry for complexes of 2 and 3 with monosaccharide substrates and the fact that the stability constants for 1 are very low and thus not determinable by UV/vis or fluorescence titrations indicate that complexation occurs by insertion of the substrate molecule into each receptor's lipophilic pocket. Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6). The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. . The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. (6). The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis. Also, due to lower sensitivity of the NMR experiment, higher mM concentrations of receptor 2 and sialic acid had to be used. However, at these concentrations the complex precipitation was observed, preventing the utilization of obtained 1 H-NMR chemical shifts for the K d determination..

The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes .

All commercially available chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer and referenced according to a residual solvent peak as an internal standard (DMSO 2.49 ppm, and CD 3 OD, 4.78 ppm). RP-HPLC analyses of reaction mixtures and products purification were performed on Finnigan SpectraSYSTEM liquid chromatography system. For RP-HPLC separation, a Phenomenex Jupiter C-18 preparative column, (250 x 21.2 mm, 10 m particle size, 300 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 7 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) or Vydac C-18 analytical column (250\u00b4 4.6 mM, 5 m particle size, 120 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 1 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) was employed, and eluting products were detected by UV at 315 nm.

INTRODUCTION]\nCarbohydrate recognition is one of the most sophisticated recognition processes in biological systems [1]. This process mediates many important aspects of cell-cell recognition, such as inflammation, cell differentiation, tumor cell colonization and metastasis. In addition, the carbohydrate structures, which decorate the cell surface of higher organisms, change with the onset of cancer and inflammation, representing highly promising targets for new and more-selective anticancer drugs and for early diagnosis. However, due to its complexity and weak binding affinities, carbohydrate recognition by natural systems is still poorly understood. On the other hand, studies of synthetic carbohydrate receptors could make significant contributions to a better understanding of this process and lead to the development of new chemotherapeutics and chemosensors. Given the importance of the carbohydrate recognition process, it is not surprising that design and synthesis of artificial receptors for these important biological substrates has attracted a great deal of attention in biomimetic and supramolecular chemistry..

Given the importance of the carbohydrate recognition process, it is not surprising that design and synthesis of artificial receptors for these important biological substrates has attracted a great deal of attention in biomimetic and supramolecular chemistry.\nFor example, artificial receptors that can selectively bind sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), a monosaccharide that is typically found at the termini of some cancer cell specific antigens (e.g., sialyl Lewis x and sialyl Lewis a), may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents that would have broad applicability to a variety of cancers [1b]..\nCurrent efforts are mainly focused on design of the receptors for complexation of mono-or disaccharides [2]. This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms . This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms [3,[7][8][9]. Binding of an individual lectin to a monosaccharide substrate is extremely weak; the dissociation constants (K d ) for these complexes are typically in the 0.1-10 mM range. This is largely due to the solvent-exposed nature of the lectin binding sites, which make few direct contacts with monosaccharide substrate.

Binding is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and van der Waals packing of the hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains forming sandwich-type interactions.\nAlthough many interesting synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in organic solvent have been developed [2], the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages. A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak.

These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin [6], calixarene , calixarene [7], porphyrin , porphyrin [8] or cage-type molecules  or cage-type molecules [9] showed that it is possible to design and synthesize artificial receptors for binding carbohydrates in water, although stabilities of their complexes are weak. These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P.

Davis et al. represents another interesting approach in the design of artificial carbohydrate receptors [10]. This molecule can bind selectively all-equatorial disaccharides such as cellobiose in water within the range of values reported for lectins. As in previously mentioned examples, hydrophobic attractions supported by CH-interactions are the driving forces for the binding of disaccharides. In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation .

In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation [2b, 11]. Boronic acid is known to react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of carbohydrates to form five or six-membered cyclic esters in basic aqueous media. However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation. Recently it was shown that receptors designed from condensed polypyridine units .

However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation. Recently it was shown that receptors designed from condensed polypyridine units [12] display very strong and selective binding of various carbohydrates in organic solvents, including polar methanol, mainly through formation of hydrogen bonds.

Therefore, condensed polypyridines present attractive building blocks for construction of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules.\nWe report here the design, synthesis and binding properties of 1,8-naphthyridine based acyclic 1, bi-bracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic 3 receptor, Fig. (1), molecules toward the various monosaccharide substrates in aqueous buffer at pH 6.5.

Our synthetic receptors are relatively small, have the desired threedimensional structure, hydrogen-bonding site and lipophilic binding pocket to promote hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n[2. RECEPTOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES]\nMacrocyclic structures are particularly useful for design of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules mainly because they are large enough to contain a spherical binding site (lipophylic cavity) of appropriate size and shape. Incorporation of condensed polypyridine units into such macrocyclic structure could result in construction of artificial receptors capable of selective carbohydrate binding in water through combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, condensed polypyridine compounds exhibit strong absorption and fluorescence emission bands, and complexation induced changes in their absorption or fluorescence spectra will allow for the determination of the stability constants.\nTo demonstrate the suitability of macrocyclic polypyridine structures for design of artificial receptors capable of binding carbohydrate substrates in water, we synthesized three types of 1,8naphthyridine based receptor molecules 1-3, Fig. (1)..\n1,8-Naphthyridine moiety has been successfully used in design of receptors for monosaccharide binding in organic solvents [12e,f], and there is strong literature evidence demonstrating that replacement of pyridine or pyrimidine with naphthyridine core moiety in some acyclic carbohydrate receptors resulted in a significant enhancement of the receptor's binding properties [12f]. However, this monosaccharide binding motif remains largely unexploited in the design and synthesis of receptors for binding and recognition of these important biological substrates in water. Synthesized bibracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic receptor 3 possess a 1,8-naphthyridine core moiety bridged with two flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amines (TREN). In these receptors, two adjacent pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as the proton acceptors (AA), while lateral TREN secondary amines function as the proton donors (DD). The relay of hydroxyl groups in monosaccharides offers an ADDA motif complementary to the DAAD array of naphthyridine receptors to form multiple H-bonds [13]. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.\n\n[3. SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECEPTORS 1-3]\n1,8-Naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4, a key receptor intermediate, was synthesized over five steps as previously reported [14]. Condensation of 1,8-naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4 with an equimolar amount of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) followed by treatment with NaBH 4 yields a mixture of receptors 2 (30%) and 3 (15%), Scheme 1. However, if the 2:3 ratio of 4 and TREN is used, the major product formed is receptor 3 (45%) while 2 cannot be detected. In both cases pure 2 and 3 were obtained after RP-HPLC purification of crude reaction mixtures. Compound 1 was prepared for control studies by condensation of 4 with two equivalents of propylamine using the same synthetic strategy. After solvent evaporation, the oily residue was redissolved in water containing 0.1 % TFA, and the final product 1 was purified by RP-HPLC. The product 1 was obtained in 60% yield. Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells .

Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells [15], we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies. The pK a values obtained for aromatic, terti- ary, secondary and primary nitrogens of receptor 2 were 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, and 10.7, respectively. In the case of UV/vis experiments, lowering the pH of the receptor 2 solution from 11 to 8 caused a decrease of the absorption intensity at 315 nm, while further lowering the pH of the solution from 8 to 1 resulted in the opposite effect. In this case, the absorption intensity increased with a bathochromic shift of the maximum wavelength ( max =319 nm, pH 1), associated with the formation of an isosbestic point at 274 nm. Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds , we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5.

Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds [16] indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39)  indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39) [17]. Based on these experiments, we can assume that at pH 6.5 in receptors 1-3 only lateral TREN primary and secondary amines will be protonated, allowing desired DAAD H-bonding arrangement for optimal interactions with monosaccharide substrates. The repulsive interactions between positively charged TREN bridges may be expected to prevent complete self-stacking of 1,8-naphthiridine units in both receptors 2 and 3 thus creating a hydrophobic binding pocket. Although the TREN bridges in both macrocyclic receptors are flexible enough to allow the binding pocket to adjust to carbohydrate substrate for optimal interactions, a greater degree of structural flexibility and conformational adaptability may be expected for the receptor 2. Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions..

As expected, comparison of the UV/vis spectra of reference compound 1 and receptors 2 and 3 taken in an aqueous buffer (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c buffer = 0.05 M, c 1 = 2 10 -4 M, max 1= 312 nm, 1 = 4725.7 M -1 cm -1 , c 2 = 10 -4 M, max 2= 315 nm, 2 = 7372.5 M -1 cm -1 , c 3 = 6.7 10 -5 , max 3= 316 nm, 3 = 13713.0 M -1 cm -1 ), shows a hypochromicity ( 3 <3 1, 2 <2 1 ), an absorption band broadening and bathochromic shift for 2 and 3. Observed effects are indicative of the presence of weak intramolecular -stacking interactions between the 1,8naphthyridine units; strong stacking interactions are reported to produce more pronounced hypochromicity and bathochromic shift [16a,c]. In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M.\nIn contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2). An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer . An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

BINDING STUDIES]\nAll examined carbohydrate substrates are commercially available. The binding affinities of receptors 1-3 toward a variety of monosaccharide substrates were examined by UV/vis, and fluorometric titration experiments in cacodylate buffer (0.05 M) at pH 6.5, and room temperature, Fig. 3 (A) and and(C). In all experiments the concentration of receptor was kept constant (c 2 =10 -4 M, c 3 =6 10 -5 M for UV/vis, and c 2 =10 -6 M, c 3 =2 10 -6 M for fluorimetric titrations), whereas the concentration of carbohydrate substrates was varied from cca 10 -5 -4 10 -2 M in the case of UV/vis and cca 10 -5 -10 -3 M in the case of fluorimetric titration experiments. The dissociation constants (K d ) were calculated using the SPECFIT global analysis software, Fig. ).

All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table ). All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table 1, receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution. Affinities toward neutral substrates are much lower and thus not determinable by fluorescence or UV/vis titration experiments under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharides mainly through charge-charge interactions and that hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions play a negligible role or no role in the complex stabilization. In support of this, no significant differences in affinities of receptor 3 toward negatively charged substrates was observed. Obtained results can be explained by the lack of flexible 2-aminoethyl \"arms\" in receptor 3 and somewhat more sterically hindered binding pocket so that complete substrate encapsulation cannot occur. On the other hand, the conformationally more flexible receptor 2 showed millimolar affinities toward neutral hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose, as well as negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and sialic acid. However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table , receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution.

However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table 1), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.\nIn order to examine the role of hydrogen bonds in stabilization of the complexes, various neutral pyranose and deoxy-pyranose   substrates were investigated. Among these substrates, receptor 2 shows binding preferences for glucose over deoxy-glucose substrates (Table 1) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose. As in previous cases, the stability constants for these complexes also were not determinable by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration experiments. This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability.

We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5).

Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.\nA similar trend in fluorescence intensity was observed for the titration of 3 with negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. An extensive literature search resulted in only one example of artificial receptors capable of discriminating between closely related monosaccharides in aqueous solutions. Cu(II)-coordinated glucose-imprinted poly(acrilate) receptor, reported by S. Striegler [21], has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation , has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation [18] can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities.\nThe observed 1:1 stoichiometry for complexes of 2 and 3 with monosaccharide substrates and the fact that the stability constants for 1 are very low and thus not determinable by UV/vis or fluorescence titrations indicate that complexation occurs by insertion of the substrate molecule into each receptor's lipophilic pocket. Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6). The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. . The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M.

The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis. Also, due to lower sensitivity of the NMR experiment, higher mM concentrations of receptor 2 and sialic acid had to be used. However, at these concentrations the complex precipitation was observed, preventing the utilization of obtained 1 H-NMR chemical shifts for the K d determination..

CONCLUSION]\nThe present results demonstrate that macrocyclic bi-bracchial 1,8-naphthyridine receptor 2 is capable of binding and recognizing monosaccharide substrates in water through multiple noncovalent interactions. The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes .

All commercially available chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer and referenced according to a residual solvent peak as an internal standard (DMSO 2.49 ppm, and CD 3 OD, 4.78 ppm). RP-HPLC analyses of reaction mixtures and products purification were performed on Finnigan SpectraSYSTEM liquid chromatography system. For RP-HPLC separation, a Phenomenex Jupiter C-18 preparative column, (250 x 21.2 mm, 10 m particle size, 300 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 7 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) or Vydac C-18 analytical column (250\u00b4 4.6 mM, 5 m particle size, 120 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 1 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) was employed, and eluting products were detected by UV at 315 nm. A solvent system consisting of 0.1% TFA in H 2 O (v/v) as A and 0.1% TFA in CH 3 CN (v/v) as B was used for HPLC elution. Mass spectral data were obtained via the Mass Spectrometry Services operated by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. UV/vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 3 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra on a Perkin Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer.\n\n[7.

The florescence emission spectra for both compounds were taken under the same conditions, except in this case, the concentration of 1 was 61 0 -7 M, and receptor 2 was 3\u00b4 10 -7 M, respectively. All the concentrations tested were within the linear response of absorbance or fluorescence intensity versus concentration.\n\n[10. Determination of pK a]\nFor the pH titration experiment, 6.5 mg of receptor 2 was dissolved in 0.21 mL of water (0.0515 M) and titrated with 0.08843 M solution of NaOH. The NaOH solution was standardized with potassium hydrogen phthalate using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The change of the UV/vis absorption spectra of receptor 2 as a function of pH was determined in the following buffers: for pH 1-3 phosphate buffer, pH 4-5 acetate buffer, pH 6-8 phosphate buffer, pH 9 Tris HCl buffer, pH 10-11 piperidine, pH 12 and 13 phosphate buffer.

In these experiments the concentration of receptor 2 or 3 was kept constant (8 10 -5 M) while the concentration of monosaccharide substrates was varied from 3 10 -5 M to 1.8 10 -3 M. The monosaccharide substrates were prepared in aqueous solution of the receptor (8 10 -5 M) in order to keep the receptor concentration constant. Under these conditions the UV/vis absorbance of the receptor 2 was proportional to its concentrations.\nThe dissociation constants (K d ) for the complex of 1:1 stoichiometry were calculated using SPECFIT software [19].

It consists of progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its onset was correlated with aging, toxic events, and metabolic causes. There is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance in Parkinson's disease, although a genetic component was incriminated in a small percentage of cases. There is strong evidence that it may be caused largely by oxidative stress and metal toxicity; patients have low levels of natural antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and high leve ls of iron in the substantia nigra and other areas of their brain, leading to the hypothesis that iron and other transition metals help catalyze the free radical reactions that destroy the dopaminergic neurons, and that high levels of antioxidants (e.g., uric acid, flavonoids, ubiquinone) may help prevent or slow down the progress of Parkinson's disease. This review paper is dedicated to analyzing this hypothesis and also attempts to define possible future directions of investigation.", "Introduction": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic illness due to the progressive degeneration of those neurons that normally produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to a dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. It is characterized by the following symptoms: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement) or akinesia (absence or difficulty in initiating movement), shuffling gait, and stooped posture; depression or dementia may also be present at later stages.\nThe most characteristic symptom, the accentuated tremor, led the British physician who first described this disease in 1817, James Parkinson, to name it \"shaking palsy\". Parkinson's disease is more common among men than among women and is four times more frequent in Caucasians than in darkly pigmented races. In the United States, PD affects about 1% of the population over age 60 [1]. Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause. It is rarely inherited and less than 1% of all cases are believed to have a genetic component. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive destruction of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain stem. The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed . Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, i.e. of no known cause.

The loss of dopamine affects the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and subsequently the output to various muscles. Symptoms develop once 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have been destroyed [1]. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficient treatment for PD. Dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is consequently administered in the form of its chemical precursor, levodopa. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissues in order to maximize its CNS effect. Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are also used. Avaiable surgical techniques are either ablative (thalamotomy and pallidotomy), augmentative (high-frequency deep-brain stimulation) or restaurative (gene therapy and neurotransplantation). Additiona l adjunctive therapies include physical therapy and nutritional counseling. However, the treatment is not curative; it can only relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease .

There is no known treatment able to halt or reverse neuronal degeneration in PD; however, substantial scientific advancements have been made in the past years towards the understanding of this disease [1]..\nThe remainder of this review paper is devoted to a brief anatomical background and to the analysis of the current hypothesis of the international research community stating that free radical toxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.", "Pathological anatomy": "The basal ganglia are a conglomeration of five distinguishable interconnected nuclei located at the base of the brain: the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum (consisting of caudate nucleus and putamen) and the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia became known as a component of the so-called extrapyramidal system, which is interconnected and cooperates with the pyramidal (corticospinal) system. The basal ganglia play an important role in voluntary movement and also have a role in cognitive function [2]..\nThe substantia nigra is a pigmented mass of neurons located in the midbrain (mesencephalon) between the cerebral peduncles and the tegmentum. It is composed of a dorsal pars compacta containing melanin pigment, a ventral pars reticulata containing iron compounds, and a pars lateralis. The dendrites of neurons in the pars compacta arborize in the pars reticulata. The neuronal population of the substantia nigra consists of pigmented and nonpigmented neurons. Pigmented neurons outnumber nonpigmented neurons two to one. The neurotransmitter in pigmented neurons is dopamine. Nonpigmented neurons are either cholinergic or GABAergic. There is a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in different disease states. Both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons are lost in patients with Huntington's chorea, another neurodegenerative disease of basal ganglia origin, which differs from PD in that it is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Only pigmented (dopaminergic) neurons are lost in PD. In idiopathic PD this loss occurs mostly in the center of the substantia nigra, while in the postencephalitic type of PD the pattern is uniform throughout the substantia nigra [2]. Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) . Besides the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, two other cell groups in the mesencephalic tegmentum are dopaminergic: the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (located in close proximity to the medial substantia nigra and usually spared in PD) and the retrorubral cell group (moderately affected in PD) [2]..\nIn postmortem studies it was discovered that the substantia nigra (meaning \"black substance\") had lost its pigment in PD patients. The pigment is called neuromelanin and was commented on as long ago as 1786 by Vicq d'Azyr. Apart from the substantia nigra, neuromelanin is also located in the locus coeruleus in the pons, where the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. It is certain, however, that neuromelanin is a recent phylogenetic development and it appears that the intensity of pigmentation is related to the degree of evolution of the brain.\nNeuromelanin is present only in the brain of humans, primates and some carnivores, e.g. the dog and the cat; it does not appear to be present in the brain of common laboratory animals, such as the rat, the guinea pig, and the rabbit. Evidence suggests that neuromelanin is not synthesized by a tyrosine-tyrosinase system as in skin melanocytes, but by a different pathway involving oxidation of brain catecholamines, in particular dopamine. Moreover, there is a striking similarity between the distribution of neuromelanin and that of the brain catecholaminesnorepinephrine and dopamine [3]. These anatomical findings inevitably led to the conclusion that melanin in neurons is intimately related to the ability of these cells to synthesize dopamine or norepinephrine. Indeed, neuromelanin may be looked upon as an indication of catecholamine synthesis in neuronal systems containing dopamine or norepinephrine. The question arises as to why melanin in neurons containing catecholamines should be practically confined to primates and carnivores. A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species .

A possibility is that the appearance of melanin in catecholamine-containing cells is the outcome of long-continued amine synthesis and depends on the life span of the species [3]..\nNeuromelanin has a strict anatomical localization and a late evolutionary appearance which suggest that it serves some positive function. Melanin deposition may provide a mechanism of inactivation of some metabolic product possibly of catecholamine origin which cannot be removed from neurons by other means. Alternatively, the chemical constituents of melanin, in particular the heavy metals it contains -zinc, copper, iron, manganese, titanium, cobalt, and nickel -may influence neuronal metabolism. A significant feature of neuromelanin is the presence of free semiquinone radicals, which might influence oxidation-reduction reactions [3]..\nParkinson's disease affects the cytoskeleton and damage occurs only in selectively vulnerable neurons. As a result of the cytoskeletal changes, the so-called Le wy bodies may appear; their major components are abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments, in other words altered \"building blocks\" of the cytoskeleton. The Lewy bodies are concentric hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions seen in pigmented nigral cells, but not in all cases of PD (e.g., not in those cases following encephalitis letargica) [3]..", "Physiopathology": "Parkinsonism may occur following carbon monoxide poisoning or cranial trauma ( e.g. dementia pugilistica, a condition seen in professional boxers such as Muhammad Ali).\nParkinson's disease may also develop later in life, in connection with a neurotoxic event that occurred at an early age, e.g. encephalitis lethargica or a whooping cough (pertussis) epidemic infection. Certain diuretics (e.g. reserpine), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (e.g. naproxen), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) and \"designer drugs\" (e.g. MPTP) have all been implicated in causing or exacerbating PD. Environmental and dietary factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, i.e. occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides, the high intake of animal fats, the high intake of sugars (mono-and disaccharides), the high aluminum content of drinking water, the mercury from dental amalgams, the presence of other metals, notably manganese, cadmium and copper, as well as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. multiple lacunar strokes) [4]..\nA consensus is now emerging that major causes of neurodegenerative diseases in general, and PD in particular, are oxidative stress (i.e., an excess of free radicals) and metal toxicity [5]..\nThe following section of this paper is devoted to the critical review of this hypothesis. In relation to this hypothesis, one of the above-mentioned causative factors, MPTP, is entitled to a special discussion. MPTP-induced parkinsonism is a model for PD in human and non-human primates and was discovered accidentally. In 1982, several heroin addicts in California and Maryland suddenly developed acute and permanent parkinsonism after injecting a synthetic opiate containing the impurity MPTP. The symptoms required constant levodopa treatment ever since. MPTP is converted by the neuronal enzyme MAO-B into its toxic metabolite MPP + which has structural similarities to dopamine and is taken up into the dopaminergic nerve terminal by the dopamine uptake system where it causes cell damage. Another drug, selegiline (or deprenyl), an almost forgotten substance that was invented by a Hungarian scientist and failed its purpose as an antidepressant, was found to have antagonist actions to MPTP since it is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, preventing dopamine depletion and PD symptoms [6]. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.. Several mechanisms of toxicity, further addressed in this paper, have been proposed to explain the actions of MPTP.", "Theories of free radical involvement in Parkinson's disease": "One of the leading hypotheses nowadays is that oxidative stress by ROS damages essential components of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, including DNA, protein structures and the cell membrane, resulting in functional disruption and ultimate cell death. These free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism, but specific cellular detoxification systems normally minimize their damaging effects [7]. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:. Although ROS level cannot be measured directly in the living patient, post-mortem studies of the brain in PD have revealed:\n1) increased membrane peroxidation in the SNc and widespread ROS-induced protein modification, with protein carbonyl levels elevated in all regions of the brain [7,8];;\n2) elevated TBA-reactive substance levels (a measure of the secondary products of lipid peroxidation) accompanied by decreased PUFA levels (the peroxidation substrate) [8];;\n3) increased 8-hydroxy-2\u2032deoxyguanosine levels in the SNc and other brain regions, indicative of ROS-mediated DNA damage [7,9]. Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage . Furthermore, the measured activities of a number of phospholipid-catabolizing enzymes in the normal SN have been found to be low compared with other regions of the human brain, suggesting slow phospholipid turnover in the SN, which would restrict the capacity for rapid repair of oxidative membrane damage [10]..\nThere are several potential metabolic sources of increased oxidative stress in PD: dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free iron levels, accumulation of AGEs, reduced activity of free radical defense systems, and the deleterious role of glial cells. Several toxins may also be implicated in PD. A brief discussion is devoted to each of these hypotheses.", "1) Dopamine metabolism": "Dopamine is oxidized in the brain via two pathways. a) Auto-oxidation of dopamine leads to the production of toxic semiquinone species (SQ \u2022 ), which via a metabolic cascade can be polymerized to neuromelanin. Little can be said with certainty about the effect of neuromelanin on neuronal function. It is generally regarded as a waste product of dopamine auto-oxidation and as a \"double-edged sword\" with respect to free radical reactions, in that it sequesters redox-active metal ions (such as iron), but may also promote ROS-generating processes and may also represent a depot for other cellular toxins, such as MPP + [11]. b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is: . b) In biochemical catalysis, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including the neuronal transmitters or hormones dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin, are broken down into their respective metabolites in a two-step enzymatic conversion. The general equation is:\nAlso, MAO-B, but not MAO-A, is found at an increased level (approximately 25% higher) in the SN of PD patients; MAO-B in blood platelets is significantly higher in PD and Alzheimer's disease [6]. This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A . This data points out the role of MAO-B in accelerating dopamine breakdown in PD pathogenesis. It is worth mentioning that, in vitro, H 2 O 2 induces the activity of MAO-B but not that of MAO-A [6]. If the same action would be confirmed in vivo, then it would be worth considering a feedback-positive mechanism in which dopamine oxidation, catalyzed by MAO-B, produces H 2 O 2 that would only further enhance the activity of MAO-B..

Both these conditions are distinctive forms of cell death, as defined morphologically; however, in neuronal populations and diseases such as PD they can either coexist or be sequential events. Fig. 1 (from  (from [12]) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. ) shows the involvement of mitochondria in cell death. Fig. 1a depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig.  depicts a severe insult resulting in death by necrosis (via prominent and persistent depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a depletion of energy) while Fig. 1b depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation). The nature of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is still undetermined, but there are indications that it involves a combination of apoptotic processes and necrotic degeneration. It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration  depicts a mild insult resulting in apoptosis (via initiation of the caspase cascade and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation). The nature of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is still undetermined, but there are indications that it involves a combination of apoptotic processes and necrotic degeneration. It is possible that low level exposure to a toxin or oxidative stress initially stimulates apoptotic losses, but with prolonged exposure can also induce necrotic neurodegeneration [7]..\nThe CNS has a particularly high energy requirement, thus making it very susceptible to  One of the known substrates of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD consists of abnormalities of the respiratory chain (schematically drawn in Fig. 2, from , from [13]). The respiratory chain consists of five complexes aligned along the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The functions of the respiratory chain are proton pumping, electron transport, conversion of atomic oxygen into water, and, most importantly, production of energy in the form of ATP. In total, the five enzyme complexes are formed by more than 80 subunits; 13 of these are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the others by nuclear DNA. In MPTP-induced parkinsonism, MPTP is metabolized to MPP + which is preferentially stored in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, where it inhibits complex I of the electron-transport chain, leading to reductions in ATP production and elevated ROS generation, which in turn result in oxidative damage to various cell structures ).

Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD . Whether this action accounts entirely for the toxic potential of MPTP is still unclear, but there is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive reduction in mitochondrial respiration (a feature of the aging brain) is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [12]. In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN . In idiopathic PD there is a 30-40% decrease in complex I activity in the SN [12,14] and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically  and reduced staining for complex I subunits in the SN, although preserved staining for subunits of other electron-transport complexes, as demonstrated immunohistochemically [15]. Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering . Strong support for a mtDNA-encoded defect comes from two studies proving that cybrids made from PD patients show reductions in complex I activity. These defects are associated with increased free radical production, increased susceptibility to MPP + and impaired mitochondrial Ca 2+ buffering [12,16]. It is now generally accepted that PD patients present a complex I defect in their substantia nigra.

Absolute iron levels are increased in PD by about 35%, specifically in the SNc [18]..\nOf particular significance in PD is the shift in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio from almost 2:1 to 1:2 [18], consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction , consistent with increased Fe(II)-catalyzed conversion of H 2 O 2 to the highly reactive \u2022 OH in the Fenton reaction [10]::\nThe reduction of Fe(III) by the superoxide radical would increase the rate of the Fenton reaction, thus driving the Haber-Weiss cycle-mediated production of \u2022 OH (4) [7]::\nThe availability of soluble iron complexes for participation in this reaction is a major determinant of the toxicity of ROS in the neuron. Iron participates in free radical-generating reactions only in the free, ferrous form. Ferric iron in the SNc is normally bound either by ferritin (about 90%) or by neuromelanin (10%). A variety of molecules with an o-dihydroxyphenyl structure (including 6-OHDA and dopamine) effectively release ferritin-bound iron in vitro and thereby stimulate lipid peroxidation [7,19]; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine ; the iron chelator desferrioxamine has antagonistic actions, protecting rats against 6-OHDA induced loss of striatal dopamine [20]..\nIn animal models, infusion of iron into the SNc induced neurodegeneration and a dose-related decline in striatal dopamine. In PD, it is not known whether the increased iron levels are due to reduced ferritin levels or increased cellular uptake of iron. It is considered unlikely that iron is involved early in the pathogenesis of PD, since laboratory tests have not indicated elevated levels of iron in the preclinical stage of the disease, however, its potent ability to generate ROS means that it may play a significant role in the progression of PD [7], especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels , especially as it is accompanied by a dramatic rise in aluminum levels [21] which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts  which would exacerbate iron-related oxidative damage; aluminum salts accelerate lipid peroxidation induced by iron salts [21]..\nIn correlation with the chemistry of iron, it was shown that the enzyme SOD may be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence comes from studies demonstrating that the inactivation of the mouse gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase leads to tissue-specific inhibition of the respiratory chain enzymes complex I and complex II, inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase and accumulation of DNA oxidative damage [22]. Complex II contains three Fe-S clusters, only one of which is tetranuclear (4Fe-4S) cluster. The inactivation of aconitase in SOD-deficient mice is likely to be caused by oxidation of its Fe-S cluster by superoxide, which liberates the iron as Fe 2+ ; this iron can then participate in the Fenton reaction, generating hydroxyl radical and leading to further oxidative damage .

A decrease in aconitase activity is seen in various neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Friedreich ataxia, and is worth exploring in PD as well.", "Accumulation of AGEs": "Advanced glycation end-products are a group of substances formed by a cascade of reaction that follow the reaction of protein amino groups (especially the N-terminal and side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine) with monosaccharide molecules [23]. Their accumulation in the ageing human brain is facilitated by oxidative stress and transition metals, including iron, and their formation is inhibited by radical scavengers and thiol antioxidants. Highly reactive dicarbonyl products and ROS are produced in the course of AGE synthesis, thus further enhancing oxidative stress. Due to these properties and their promotion of protein cross-linking, AGEs have been implicated in degenerative disorders associated with ageing in the periphery as well as in the CNS .

In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques . In Alzheimer's disease, AGEs promote the polymerization of \u00df-amyloid, the major component of plaques [24], and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation , and may similarly be involved in PD in cross-linking underlying Lewy body formation [24]. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.. In the SN of PD patients were identified two AGEs (pentosidine and pyralline) and heme-oxygenase-1, a putative marker for oxidative stress.\nHeme-oxygenase-1 immunoreactivity was localized to the filaments of Lewy bodies, suggesting a particular sensitivity of the cytoskeleton [24]..", "Reduced activity of free radical defense systems": "The cellular radical detoxification system (its most important components being SOD and GPx) is supposed to neutralize free radicals by catalyzing reactions ( 5) and ( ) and ( 6), respectively:), respectively:\nHowever, the activity of this system declines, even with normal aging, and, even in normal individuals, the neurons in the SNc are particularly vulnerable enzymatically. In the normal brain, nigral GSH levels are low in comparison with other brain regions [25]. In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN. Of the other enzymes which modulate GSH levels, only the levels of ?-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is associated with GSH translocation and degradation, are significantly different (doubled). This change is restricted to PD and the SNc . In PD, there is a further decline in GSH levels without an increase in the oxidized form, GSSG, which suggests a decrease in GPx activity in the SN.

It seems that the decline in GSH levels occurs early in the course of the disorder, and hence the view that GSH depletion represents a \"first blow\" that renders the cell vulnerable to neurodegeneration possibly induced by other factors [25]..\nMelatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland (epiphysis) and involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm, was recently reported to have antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties in animal and cell culture models: free radical scavenging, up-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes (including SOD and GPx) and inhibition of NOS [26]. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.. Endogenous melatonin levels decline with age, and this change may increase the vulnerability of susceptible regions to oxidative damage.", "The deleterious actions of glial cells": "The debate focusing on the role of glial cells in PD is very interesting. Until recently, it was assumed that glial cells have a protective role, since glial cell distribution is not uniform across the brainstem: it is lowest in the areas that are prone to PD and highest in the areas where dopaminergic neurons are preserved [27]. The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx . The mechanisms of neuroprotection by the glial cells could consist of secretion of trophic factors or the high degree of expression of GPx [27]..\nHowever, it was suggested recently that glial cells may damage dopaminergic neurons by secreting factors that might diffuse into neurons or act on membrane receptors. The density of glial cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, interferon ? and interleukine 1\u00df is increased in the SN in PD [28]. Cytokines were found to induce the expression of CD23, a low-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor which, following appropriate ligation, induces the expression of the enzyme NOS II that produces nitric oxide which is diffusible and may penetrate into neurons, combine with superoxide radicals and form peroxinitrates that are extremely toxic; indeed, the concentration of nitrites is increased in the CSF of PD patients .

The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.. The TNF-a levels in CSF were determined by ELISA.\nThe mean TNF-a level was 2.6-fold higher in CSF specimens from PD patients than in those of controls. It was shown that CSF specimens obtained by lombar puncture from these patients were cytotoxic to dopaminergic neurons in primary mesencephalic cell culture. Specimens of CSF were evaluated in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell lines for cytotoxicity by viability assay and by the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. Cytotoxicity was assessed by cell structure and cell viability staining. To explore the possible involvement of apoptotic mechanisms in CSF-induced cell injury, these cells were also stained for DNA fragmentation with the TUNEL technique. A typical pattern that included nuclear chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation was apparent after incubation with CSF, suggesting the role of apoptotic mechanisms. Along with TNF-a, interleukin 1\u00df was also elevated in CSF in PD [31]..\nA summary of the potential deleterious or neuroprotective actions of glial cells is shown in Figure 3 (from  (from [27]):):\nFig. 3.

The potential deleterious and neuroprotective effects of glial cells", "7) The generation of free radicals by toxins in PD": "The recognition that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by MPP + (and also by paraquat and 6-OHDA) not only leads to energy deficits but also the generation of O 2 ? -, ? OH and H 2 O 2 , and thus possibly to oxidative stress, stimulated the search for a \"natural\" inhibitor that might represent the causative agent in PD [7]. The possibility that an external toxin is involved was suggerated by epidemiological studies which found a greater risk for PD associated with exposure to any of a range of seemingly unrelated variables: agricultural chemicals, industrial environments, different metals. The development of multifactorial or interaction models may allow the detection of at-risk individuals without first identifying a specific toxin .

The development of multifactorial or interaction models may allow the detection of at-risk individuals without first identifying a specific toxin [7]..\nA summary of the cellular mechanisms which may be involved in the neurodegenerative process in PD is shown in Figure 4 (from  (from [7]) in an attempt to develop such an interaction model, taking into consideration the dynamics of all the factors shown above: challenge to engage in this research field, considering that there is, in fact, no known treatment able to halt or reverse the process of degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The hope for a cure is still alive, and a cure will be eventually found; however, it is remarkable that, with practically no clinical approach left untried, the best is yet to come in Parkinson's disease therapy. As far as we know, neurodegeneration-whether slower or faster-is irreversible. Every single method that has been tried until now has its own limitations, and none is universal. Responsiveness to levodopa decreases gradually; immunotherapy has failed; graft survival in neurotransplantation is variable and restricted by the number of human fetal donors avaiable; xenotransplantation is subject to acute vascular rejection after a few days; thalamotomy abolishes tremor only unilaterally; gene therapy is by no means performed on a large scale, and in none of the above was a full recovery ever recorded. The answer is probably to be found in the title of another article, that of M. Piccolino: Old Cells, Old Experiments, New Results. The critical assimilation of the literature does not lead to the belief that the cure for Parkinson's disease will consist in a \"magic bullet\", as penicillin was for tuberculosis in the the time of Alexander Fleming.

It is more likely that, starting from the existing accomplishments of the contemporary research scene, several main directions of future investigation will emerge.\nA scientist true to the classical conception of the anatomical school would indeed choose to pursue the hard facts: that only pigmented neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease, and will focus on neuromelanin as an indication of catecholamine synthesis or a side-product of dopamine auto-oxidation in neurons. The properties of neuromelanin will certainly have to be investigated in detail, since its chemical identity with oculocutaneous melanin has never been established. Valuable starting points are the facts that: 1) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is localized in neurons and not in melanocytes; 2) unlike skin and eye melanin, neuromelanin is present (spared) in the genetic disease albinism -an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase; 3) the skin pigment seems to be a protective factor in some races against neurodegeneration, a cutaneous barrier that would bind toxins as neuromelanin binds MPP + ; 4) primary malignant mela nomas of the CNS are not recorded; 4) neuromelanin binds and accumulates heavy metals. Regarding the comparison with skin melanin, it is significant that pigmented cells called melanophores in heterothermic vertebrates (e.g. amphibians) possess dopamine receptors that mediate melanosome aggregation and melonosome dispersion, and also receptors for norepinephrine [33]. Thus the ligand-receptor type of interaction between dopamine and melanin could be further explored at epithelial and neural level; on the basis of dose-response curves, a characterization of these receptors could be attempted as a function of agonist affinity; the goal of such a research project would be the identification of several classes of receptors based on differences in their expression. The histochemical and spectroscopic properties of neuromelanin will have to be studied in detail, since the anatomical distribution, the biochemical pathways and the selective vulnerability to various diseases do not argue in favor of their chemical identity. A logical starting point would be the examination of the spatial structures of these biopolymers generally called melanins by Xray diffraction techniques in a synchrotron radiation facility, by following changes in diffraction data during polymerization or depolymerization of melanins. This may help understanding the structural changes at different levels of organization in melanins. Also, since neuromelanin contains small amounts of metals, the immediate chemical environment of the heavy atom in the melanin structure and the location of the binding sites may also be worth investigating, and the most appropriate technique would probably be EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure). The principle of EXAFS is that when X-rays traverse a sample under study, the transmitted beam suffers an attenuation which normally changes monotonically; if the sample contains a heavy atom, the attenuation increase steeply. Conventional techniques as Perls staining and transmission electron microscopy have failed to properly serve the purposes of identifying neuromelanin granules in brain slices, but a promising technique is LAMMA (laser microprobe mass analyzer), an advanced type of mass spectrophotometer; the recording of peaks corresponds to increased quantities of iron and aluminum that may exist in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it is important to note that neuromelanin is believed to coexist in granules with lipofuscin, and that the nature of their association is at present very poorly understood; a starting point for future directions of research would be the model system in which bleaching with hydrogen peroxide gradually converts the optical and histochemical properties of melanin to those of lipofuscin and the reverse, in which lipofuscin, experimentally melanized with catecholamines, acquires characteristic optical properties of neuromelanin .

Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.. Further investigation of this concept have materialized up to now in quantification of fluorescence intensity versus wavelength; future studies would help further characterize these spectra.\nFrom the point of view of the physiologist, however, the most important issue would be function, and not structure. Recent studies have expanded the abnormalities of dopaminergic neurons well beyond the limits of the substantia nigra, and have challenged the conservative view that this is exclusively a motor system disorder. In PD, abnormal visually evoked potentials led to the conclusion that visual dysfunction is a result of dopaminergic deficiency in both humans and animals [35]. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.. Pathology, especially the toxic metabolite MPP + , may alter the balance between dopamine receptors. Dopamine might act in the retina by decoupling electrotonic junctions of horizontal cells involved in areal summation of photoreceptor signals.\nLight stimulates retinal tyrosine hydroxylase leading to the release of dopamine. Dopamine has a role in visual adaptation and in the center-surround organization of retinal receptive fields in various mammalian species. Obviously, neurophysiological techniques using intracellular recordings would be the best method of pursuing the issue of the broader functions of dopaminergic neurons affected in PD.\nThere is also evidence of an endogenous retinal clock regulating photoreceptor sensitivity [36]. Recent data suggest circadian control of contrast sensitivity via dopaminergic mechanisms in PD. How and where the circadian regulator interacts with endogenous relase and uptake of dopamine in the visual pathway is not known. As a physiology student, the author of this paper would attempt to suggest a correlation between the role of melatonin as a regulator of the circadian rhythm and this retinal clock, as endogenous melatonin levels decline with age and its role may be partly overtaken, in order to maintain the usual sleep-wakefulness cycle, by other systems in the body, notably the dopaminergic system of neural transmission; when suffering of PD, this might affect elderly individuals. It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep..

It is also very important to stress that parkinsonian tremor disappears almost completely during sleep.\nIt also may be that a relationship exists between retinal visual defects and cognitive visual dysfunction. PD patients have, indeed, deficits in performing orientation-dependent visual tasks.\nHowever, retinal neurons do not show orientation selectivity; these findings would suggest cortical defects. One possible reason may be that ascending dopamine deficiency may affect prefrontal circuits involved in the mnemonic coding of visual space. Another explanation would be that higher cortical structures are affected. These were indeed found to be the hippocampus (involved in short-term memory, which is the first type of memory to decline with age) and the brain amygdala, which influences autonomic and neurosecretory nuclei in the hypothalamus, and therefore the endocrine system. Neuroendocrine correlations, as was the previous one between melatonin and dopamine, would lead to completely novel physiological hypotheses.\nA young immunologist would seek the revival of the abandoned autoimmune theory and would note that in PD the glial cells start phagocytizing neurons and express the HLA-DR antigen which is absent in controls; glial cells may signal to the periphery since they also express receptors for interleukin 2 which is secreted presumably only by T-cells [37]. A pharmacologist would probably have the strongest arguments for a research proposal. Antipsychotic medication in the form of neuroleptics prescribed for schizophrenia and mania (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol) act by blocking the dopamine receptors and induce side effects as tardive dyskinesia, depigmentation of the SN neurons and skin sensitivity .

The answer provided comes from the context that these drugs interact with melanins, which can be studied using various methods such as whole body autoradiography. The double role of chlorpromazine as a free radical scavenger and a generator of toxic metabolites should also be taken into consideration.\n4. QAR:\nQuestion: What is the relationship between retinal visual defects and cognitive visual dysfunction in PD patients?\nAnswer: PD patients have deficits in performing orientation-dependent visual tasks, suggesting cortical defects. These defects may be related to ascending dopamine deficiency affecting prefrontal circuits involved in the mnemonic coding of visual space or higher cortical structures such as the hippocampus and the brain amygdala.\nReason: This question is unique because it focuses on the relationship between retinal visual defects and cognitive visual dysfunction in PD patients.

In addition, detection of polysaccharide antigens in body fluids by immunologic assays has been advanced, and constitutes an important diagnostic tool in different clinical scenarios. The polysaccharides detected are galactomannans of Aspergillus spp., 9 and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others,  and Histoplasma capsulatum, 10 \u03b2(1\u21923)-glucan of various fungi, including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii and others, 11 and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans.  and glucuronoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neofor-mans. 12 However, a major problem is the occurrence of false-positive results related in some cases to cross-reactivity with other fungi.

This finding has important implications for understanding the physiology of medically important fungi and could potentially lead to new targets for antifungal treatment.\nReason: The discovery that O-linked oligosaccharides are structurally similar to N-linked glycans suggests that they may be recognized by the same glycosyl transferases, which could provide potential targets for drug development in A. fumigatus.\n2.

Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. . Therefore, alterations in neuronal activity will be reflected in changes in glucose consumption, and, conversely, constraints in the availability of glucose and oxygen will limit neuronal activity. 13 C MRS after administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to human volunteers or to experimental animals is well suited to investigate the relationship between neuronal activity, energy requirements, and glucose metabolism, because several of the downstream metabolites of glucose (lactate, alanine, glutamate, glutamine GABA, aspartate -see Fig. 1) can be detected by 13 C MRS.

This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. ). This is so, because glutamate is present in concentrations that allow detection by 13 C MRS, and because virtually all glucose that enters the brain is metabolized through glutamate: glutamate equilibrates with \u03b1-ketoglutarate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, through which glucose is metabolized oxidatively. Briefly, 13 C-glucose is metabolized to 13 C-acetyl-CoA, which reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Acetyl-CoA gives rise to the 1 st and 2 nd carbons of citrate, which correspond to the 5 th and 4 th carbon positions in \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Fig. 2). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. ). Logically, these two positions are the first to be labeled from glucose, provided that uniformly labeled glucose, [U-13 C]glucose is being used. If [1-13 C]glucose is used, which is often the case, the 2 nd position of acetyl-CoA becomes labeled, and hence the 4 th position of glutamate (e.g. Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Shank et al., 1993;Mason et al., 1999;see Figs. 1 and 2)..\nHowever, when \u03b1-ketoglutarate is metabolized further through the TCA cycle, succinate is formed. Succinate has four carbon atoms and is symmetrical, so the label is now scrambled between the 1 st + 2 nd positions and the 3 rd + 4 th positions (or the 2 nd and 3 rd positions if [1-13 C]glucose is being used). From succinate fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate are formed before another molecule of acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form citrate. The labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate correspond to the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate. Labeling of these positions in glutamate reflects passage of 13 C through the TCA cycle (Fig. 1 and and2). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated ). From the labeling of the 2 nd and 3 rd vs. the 4 th positions in glutamate from [1-13 C]glucose an impression of the TCA cycle rate may be gained, or the rate may even be calculated (Hassel et al., 1995a;1997;Mason et al., 1999;Hyder et al., 2003). Fig. . Fig. 2. Simplified scheme of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Glucose is metabolized glycolytically to pyruvate, which may undergo decarboxylation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction to become acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to condense with oxaloacetate (OAA) and form citrate. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA that contribute to citrate (and hence \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA) are shown in italics. Due to the symmetry of succinate these two carbons are distributed evenly between the C1+C2 positions and the C3+C4 positions in succinate and in fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate, which are formed downstream of succinate. Pyruvate may also become aminated to alanine or reduced to lactate.. Simplified scheme of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons ). It has been shown with various techniques that aspartate is concentrated in GABAergic neurons (Ottersen and Storm-Mathisen, 1985;Hassel et al., 1992;1995b). With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose . With 13 C MRS this has been verified by blocking the TCA cycle of GABAergic neurons specifically; this leads to a marked reduction in the 13 C labeling of aspartate from [1-13 C]glucose (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a;Johannessen et al., 2001)..\nInhibition of TCA cycle activity by drugs or toxins may reduce the 13 C labeling of glutamate, GABA, or glutamine from [ 13 C]glucose (e.g. Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995a). But because TCA cycle activity is closely coupled to neuronal activity, any influence that reduces brain activity (e.g. anesthetics, antiepileptic drugs) will reduce glucose metabolism in the brain and hence 13 C labeling of glucose metabolites. Therefore, a reduction in the labeling of cerebral metabolites from [ 13 C]glucose must be interpreted with some caution. Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition..

Such a reduction does not necessarily imply a direct effect, e.g. of a drug, on TCA cycle activity, for instance through enzyme inhibition.\nConversely, any influence that leads to increased activation of the brain may increase glucose metabolism and increase 13 C labeling from [ 13 C]glucose. Such effects have been seen in human subjects and in rats (Hyder et al., 1996;Patel et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that although previous studies on a variety of experimentally induced conditions, including epileptic seizures and stroke, have shown increased uptake of the glucose analogue deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (PET) or autoradiographic methods, data obtained with 13 C MRS seem to indicate that the oxidative metabolism of glucose may be only little affected or even reduced .

The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury . The same is true for other conditions that would be expected to entail an increased energy demand, e.g. traumatic brain injury (Bartnik et al., 2007;Scafidi et al., 2009). Deoxyglucose is a substrate for the glucose transporter in the blood-brain barrier and in neurons, as well as for the first enzyme of glucose metabolism, hexokinase, which phopsphorylates glucose and deoxyglucose to their 6-phospho-derivatives. But once phophorylated deoxyglucose is not metabolized further and accumulates intracellularly; this allows its detection by PET or autoradiography. It follows that the deoxyglucose-based methods strictly detect the transport and initial phosphorylation of deoxyglucose, whereas 13 C MRS detection of glutamate labeling from [ 13 C]glucose reflects both glycolytic and oxidative metabolic activity in the brain..

It soon became clear, however, that the increase in glucose metabolism caused by various forms of physiological activation, was quite small, and not always readily detectable on the background of a high basal metabolic rate in the unanesthetized brain (Shulman et al., 2004)..", "Visualization of the metabolic interplay between astrocytes and neurons": "The cellular complexity of the brain makes it difficult to assess the metabolic activity of individual cell types separately. However, because some metabolic pathways are unique to certain cells, and because some metabolic substrates are metabolized selectively by certain cell types, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible. First we consider the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons as a precursor for glutamate and GABA in neurons. Thereafter we discuss the transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes during glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nIn the brain, acetate is metabolized oxidatively by astrocytes and not by neurons. Because astrocytes express glutamine synthetase (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 1977), isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den , isotopically labeled acetate (given i.v. or intracerebrally) leads to preferential labeling of glutamine (van den Berg et al., 1969;Hassel et al., 1997;Lebon et al., 2002;Deelchand et al., 2009). Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase . Glutamine is exported from astrocytes to the extracellular fluid, from where it is taken up by neurons, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Inside neurons glutamine becomes deamidated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001), a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons. In GABAergic neurons C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 33 the glutamine-derived glutamate becomes decarboxylated to GABA by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme that in the brain is expressed in inhibitory GABAergic neurons , a mitochondrial enzyme, which in the brain appears to be expressed only by neurons.

Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. . Therefore, when administration of 13 C-labeled acetate to experimental animals leads to 13 C labeling of GABA, this labeling illustrates a series of metabolic and transport-related events (Fig. 3) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA ) that highlights the role of (astrocytic) glutamine as a precursor of (neuronal) glutamate and GABA (Hassel et al., 1997). An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. . An enigma of brain metabolism is why acetate is oxidized only by astrocytes and not by neurons. Waniewski and Martin (1998) provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes. This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters  provided evidence that acetate is taken up across the cell membrane only in astrocytes. This finding was unexpected, since acetate is a small monocarboxylate, for which neurons are richly equipped with transporters (Bergersen, 2007). . Nguyen et al (2007b) later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase  later found that neurons take up propionate (which is closely related to acetate), which suggested that even acetate is taken up (but not metabolized) by neurons. Later it was found that administration of propionate to mice leads to an increase in brain GABA levels, suggesting an inhibitory action of propionate on the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase (Hassel et al., unpublished). GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons . GABA transaminase is an intramitochondrial enzyme in GABAergic neurons (Schousboe et al., 1974), and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives., and its inhibition by a small monocarboxylate such as propionate suggests that propionate (and acetate) is taken up by neurons and neuronal mitochondria, but that the latter are deficient in the enzyme that converts acetate and propionate into their mitochondrial CoA derivatives.\nBecause glutamate is readily labeled from 13 C-labeled precursors, there has been considerable interest in identifying transmitter glutamate with 13 C MRS. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. While glutamate serves many functions in the brain, it has been estimated that 2-20% of the total amount of brain glutamate serves a neurotransmitter function (Hassel and Dingledine, 2006). After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine . After release from synaptic nerve endings glutamate is largely taken up by astrocytes that surround the synaptic cleft, and converted into glutamine (Danbolt, 2001). This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate . This process may be illustrated with 13 C MRS. Administration of 13 C-labeled glucose to experimental animals leads to rapid 13 C labeling of glutamate and, after a delay, of glutamine. This labeling of glutamine to a large extent reflects uptake of (neuronal) transmitter glutamate into astrocytes. This was shown in an experiment in which mice had their astrocytic TCA cycle inhibited by the gliaspecific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate (Hassel et al., 1997). The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. . The mice could not form glutamate or glutamine through their TCA cycle activity, but they still produced 13 Cglutamine from 13 C-glucose. Formation of glutamine from 13 C-glucose was interpreted to reflect formation of 13 C-glutamate from 13 C-glucose in neurons, release of 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate from neurons, uptake into astrocytes of the released 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate and subsequent amidation by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 4).).\nThe exchange between neurons and astrocytes of glutamate and glutamine has been the subject of many studies, in both human subjects and experimental animals (Shen et al., 1999; see  see Rothman et al., 1999;2003, for review). Interpretation of 13 C MRS after infusion of 13 Clabeled glucose into awake humans indicated that the flux of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was close to 50% of the cerebral metabolism of glucose. This would suggest a massive transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes. However, if this is true, it is still not known whether all this glutamate is transmitter glutamate in the sense that it originates from presynaptic vesicles..

As will become evident below ('Identification of alternative substrates for brain energy metabolism'), lactate and pyruvate have become regarded as more purely neuronal substrates that are used by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons alike, whereas glycerol appears to be a substrate specifically used by GABAergic neurons (Nguyen et al., 2003). Thus, some degree of metabolic dissection of the brain is made possible by combining the administration of an appropriate 13 C-labeled energy substrate with 13 C MRS.  .

Uptake of transmitter glutamate by astrocytes. In this experiment mice received the glia-specific metabolic inhibitor fluoroacetate, which blocks the astrocytic TCA cycle at the level of aconitase. Thus, the ability of astrocytes to form glutamate and hence glutamine from \u03b1-ketoglutarate from their own TCA cycle was blocked. Even so, glutamine was formed from [ 13 C]glucose, presumably because 13 C-labeled transmitter glutamate was still being released from neurons and taken up by astrocytes with subsequent formation of [ 13 C]glutamine. The upper spectrum is from the brain of a mouse that received [1,2-13 C]acetate and [1-13 C]glucose. The doubly labeled acetate gives rise to the double peaks in glutamine C4 (peak 7). The lower spectrum is from a mouse, whose astrocytic TCA ycle was blocked by fluoroacetate; here only glutamine labeled from [1-13 C]glucose (single peak 7) can be seen .

Even so, a number of substrates may feed into the glycolytic pathway or the TCA cycle of brain cells. For example, lactate, which was shown by 13 C MRS to be a substrate for brain metabolism in mice (Hassel and Br\u00e5the, 2000), was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions , was recently shown by 13 C MRS to contribute importantly to energy metabolism in the human brain under physiological conditions (Gallagher et al., 2009;Boumezbeur et al., 2010). The ability of a substrate to function as a metabolic substrate for brain cells depends on its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, i.e. on the presence of specific transporter proteins in the barrier. Further, brain cells must have the necessary transporters to take the substrates up from the extracellular fluid as well as the enzymes necessary for their metabolism. A substrate that is not metabolized in the brain after i.v. injection may prove to be metabolized after intracerebral injection, a finding that points to transport limitations at the blood-brain barrier; this holds true for dicarboxylates like fumarate and malate .

A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose ; if injected directly into the brain parenchyma, these substrates are taken up into astrocytes and rapidly metabolized through the TCA cycle to glutamine, indicating the presence of the plasma membrane dicarboxylate transporter predominantly in astrocytes. A similar situation exists for the monosaccharide fructose (Hassel et al., submitted), which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, if fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro , which hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier at all. This can be shown by giving mice [ 13 C]fructose i.v.; in contrast to liver, the brain does not accumulate the injected [ 13 C]fructose, as can be shown by 13 C MRS of brain and liver extracts. However, if fructose is injected into the brain parenchyma, it becomes metabolized. The oxidation of fructose by brain tissue would explain the ability of fructose to support energy-requiring processes, such a axonal activity, in vitro (Meakin et al., 2007)..\nEven though a substrate crosses the blood-brain barrier, the enzymatic machinery required for its metabolism may not be present in the brain. An example is propionate, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, but hardly becomes metabolized in the brain (Nguyen et al., 2007b;Morland et al., in prep). The enzymes required for the initial metabolism of propionate, propionyl-CoA synthetase is expressed at low levels, making it difficult to detect propionate metabolites by 13 C MRS after i.v. administration of [ 13 C]propionate to experimental animals. Cerebral metabolism of propionate may be detected with radiolabeled propionate, however, owing to the higher sensitivity of radiodetective methods (scintillation counting) than of 13 C MRS .

The predominant labeling of glutamate (over glutamine) points to a predominantly neuronal metabolism of these subtrates (Fig.  have been shown to be energy substrates for the brain after i.v. injection, pointing to the existence of the appropriate monocarboxylate transporters at the blood-brain barrier. The predominant labeling of glutamate (over glutamine) points to a predominantly neuronal metabolism of these subtrates (Fig. 5). Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain ). Even octanoate has been shown to be metabolized by the brain (Ebert et al., 2003), suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3.

The labeling of amino acids in the brain from [ 13 C]acetate is on a level similar to that achieved with [ 13 C]glucose , suggesting a certain capacity for fatty acid metabolism in the brain; the preferential labeling of glutamine pointed to astrocytes as the main metabolic compartment. 13 C-Labeled acetate also yields good labeling of cerebral amino acids, predominantly glutamine, after i.v. injection, a finding that points to their metabolism in astrocytes (see above, 3.

In fact, any 13 C-labeled substrate that gives rise to 13 C-labeled acetyl-CoA will label glutamate and glutamine in positions that reflect the entry of label into the TCA cycle and its subsequent turning in the cycle. This applies to 13 C-labeled lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate, glycerol, and others. However, substrates that give C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Neurobiology -Its Use in Monitoring Brain Energy Metabolism and in Identifying Novel Metabolic Substrates and Metabolic Pathways 39 rise to 13 C-labeled pyruvate in the brain (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glycerol) may enter the TCA cycle through two different enzymatic routes. The first, which gives rise to acetyl-CoA, is pyruvate dehydrogenase, which removes a carboxylic group from pyruvate in the form of CO 2 . The second route involves the addition of a carboxylic group (from CO 2 or HCO 3 -) to pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate or its immediate precursor malate (See upper part of Fig. 7); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation. In astrocytes, the reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, in neurons, it may be catalyzed by malic enzyme. These reactions are 'anaplerotic', meaning that they function to 'fill up' the TCA cycle with intermediates. They are thought to compensate for the loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in export of glutamine from astrocytes and for the similar loss of \u03b1-ketoglutarate inherent in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission when (See below) astrocytes take up glutamate or GABA from the synaptic cleft. Decarboxylation of these malates produces 13 CO 2 as well as unlabeled CO 2 . The 13 C is represented in italics.); these reactions are known as pyruvate carboxylation.

The 13 C is represented in italics.\nWhen pyruvate is 13 C-labeled these reactions lead to the formation of 13 C-labeled malate and oxaloacetate. Pyruvate labeled in the 3 rd carbon (which originates from glucose labeled in the 1 st position, [1-13 C]glucose) leads to formation of malate or oxaloacetate labeled in the 3 rd carbon. This carbon position corresponds to the 2 nd carbon in glutamate and glutamine. In several studies the greater labeling of the 2 nd than the 3 rd carbon in glutamine has been taken as evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in astrocytes (Shank et al., 1993;Hassel et al., 1995a;Serres et al., 2008). A similar preferential labeling of the 2 nd over the 3 rd carbon in glutamate has not been consistently found, apparently pointing to the absence of pyruvate carboxylation in neurons. However, oxaloacetate and malate tend to equilibrate with the symmetrical fumarate, leading to scrambling of label between the two carbon position. 13 C MRS evidence of such scrambling in neurons has been reported in both cultured neurons .

Another way to study pyruvate carboxylation is to use glucose labeled in the 2 nd position. Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13 C]glucose) does not label acetyl-CoA, but it may label the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through pyruvate carboxylation. .

Glucose labeled in this position ([2-13 C]glucose) does not label acetyl-CoA, but it may label the 2 nd and 3 rd positions in glutamate and glutamine through pyruvate carboxylation. Mason et al (2007) showed in awake human subjects the flux through pyruvate carboxylation to be approximately 6% of that through pyruvate dehydrogenase (the activity of which was studied with [1-13 C]glucose).

This process takes place in the brain (Cerdan et al., 1990;Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b;Cruz et al., 1998) as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate  as it does in liver. In one study this process was identified in brain by 13 C MRS of brain extracts from rats that had received [ 13 C]acetate, which labeled lactate (Hassel and Sonnewald, 1995b).

This weakness implies that 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates have to be given in large amounts to achieve detection of their metabolites. In contrast, radiolabeling studies are done with minute quantities of substrate. In an attempt to improve 13 C MRS sensitivity, hyperpolarization of 13 C-labeled substrates has been done prior to i.v. injection. The MRS signal may thus be enhanced more than 10,000 times (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003). In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used . In some studies pyruvate, which is labeled in the carboxylic position, [1-13 C]pyruvate, has been used (Hurd et al., 2010;Marja\u0144ska et al., 2010;Mayer et al., 2011). The [ 13 C]pyruvate is hyperpolarized immediately before i.v. injection. The hyperpolarization is lost within some seconds, however, and the detection of metabolism of pyruvate is restricted to 13 C-labeled lactate, alanine, and CO 2 (see Fig. .

Formation of 13 CO 2 has been interpreted to reflect pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, i.e. the formation of acetyl-CoA, which may enter the TCA cycle to form citrate. But in the brain the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is quite low (Morland et al., 2007), and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes , and formation of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids takes several minutes (Gonzalez et al., 2005), so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. , so a more likely explanation for the formation of 13 CO 2 within a few seconds is reversible pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 3): [ 13 C]pyruvate is carboxylated to [ 13 C]malate, which equilibrates with (the symmetrical) fumarate, so that 13 C is distributed evenly between the two carboxylic groups of fumarate.

Researchers have tried to improve sensitivity by using hyperpolarized labeled substrates, such as [1-13 C]pyruvate. However, the use of anesthesia during studies with hyperpolarized substrates has been shown to reduce brain metabolism of 13 C-labeled substrates.\n2. How has the use of 13 C MRS contributed to our understanding of brain energy metabolism?\nAnswer: The use of 13 C MRS has provided valuable information on the fluxes and pathways of brain energy metabolism, such as glucose and lactate, in both healthy and disease states. It has also helped identify abnormalities in energy metabolism in various neurological conditions.\n3. What are some potential applications of 13 C MRS in the diagnostic workup of malignant tumors?\nAnswer: Studies have suggested that hyperpolarized [13 C]pyruvate may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring tumor response to therapy, as tumors tend to convert pyruvate into lactate at a greater rate than surrounding tissue. This could potentially serve as a non-invasive method for evaluating tumor metabolism and treatment efficacy.\n4. What are some of the advantages of 13 C MRS over other imaging techniques, such as PET or fMRI?\nAnswer: 13 C MRS offers several advantages, including its ability to directly measure metabolite concentrations in vivo, provide quantitative information on energy metabolism, and not requiring the injection of exogenous tracers. Additionally, it can be used to study brain function in human subjects without exposure to ionizing radiation.\n5. How have researchers used 13 C MRS to investigate the effects of anesthesia on brain metabolism?\nAnswer: Researchers have used 13 C MRS to investigate how anesthesia affects brain energy metabolism, particularly in terms of glucose and lactate concentrations.

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements.

The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ).

In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4).

In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4).

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .", "Conclusion": "Protonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups.

The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin. This selective interaction is much more pronounced in basic media in which glucosamine is not protonated.", "Self-association in DMSO": "This section explains the calculation model and process of \u03b4 given by Equation 2for selfassociation.

In addition to including tests regarding the potency and more restrictive limits for impurities, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was introduced as an identity test.

The NMR test allowed one to define the similarity of the test sample relative to a porcine heparin reference standard, as well as to examine if non-heparin signals could be possibly associated with impurities or contaminants (6)..\nBecause China is responsible for roughly half of the world's pig production, about 60% of the heparin supply comes from this country. In recent years the US FDA has expressed significant interest in considering reintroduction of bovine heparin drug product to the US market to mitigate the risk of supply chain issues due to the lack of source material and to diversify the source of heparin drugs globally (7). The FDA, assisted by experts coming from non-profit organizations, industries and academic institutions, is investigating the structural differences between porcine, and bovine heparins and their possible clinical implications.

This method, calculating the percentage of monosaccharide and disaccharide building blocks, can distinguish the heparin source as well as identify possible structural modification of the heparin chains induced by the purification process, often undetectable in one-dimensional NMR data. The HSQC method, applied to libraries of BMH, PMH, OMH, and BLH heparin batches coming from different suppliers provided a basis set of characteristics for each heparin source and of their structural variability. Phosphate buffer solution was prepared as follows: 49.7 mg of sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrate (0.36 mmol), 202.9 mg of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14 mmol), and 0.92 mg deuterated EDTA d-16 (0.003 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of water.

Of the types tested here, proton NMR spectra of BMH have the most observable differences compared to other heparins. Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies ).

Particularly, the heparin signals at 5.31 and 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the H1 and H5/H6 of the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine, respectively, had greater intensities in BMH spectra compared to those observed in the spectra of other heparin sources. This observation was consistent with the observation of lower 6-O-sulfation levels in bovine mucosa heparin described in previous studies (8,19). The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.. The spectrum of bovine lung heparin (BLH) showed structural peculiarities compared other spectra, particularly evident in the lower intensity of the acetyl peak at 2.05 ppm. By contrast, proton spectra of PMH and OMH were more similar, even though a reduction of the acetyl peak intensity can be observed in the spectra of OMH compared to PMH data.\nThe idea to integrate diagnostic signals of carbon and proton NMR spectra to distinguish bovine and porcine heparin was first proposed by Casu et al. (8) and then by Tovar et al.  and then by Tovar et al. (20) and Fu et al.  and Fu et al. (14). The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil . The identification test for bovine mucosa heparin, currently used by the drug regulatory agency of Brazil (15), uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively. However, because the anomeric proton signal of GlcNS,6S used by the ANVISA method, at least at magnetic field lower than 600 MHz, partially overlaps with those of N-sulfated glucosamine linked to iduronic acid (GlcNS-I) and N-acetyl glucosamine linked to glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-G) (Figure , uses the ratio between the integral values of proton anomeric signals belonging to glucosamine 6-O-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated residues, with chemical shifts at 5.40 and 5.31 ppm, respectively.

As reference signals we chose the H2 of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) and the acetyl signal of N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) which have chemical shift values of 3.28 and 2.04 ppm, respectively, and are well separated from the other signals (annotated peaks 2 and 3 of Figure ), we decided to use different signals which had less interference from other monosaccharides.

For a marker for the 6-O-desulfated glucosamine population, typical of BMH, the H5 and H6 protons signals (3 protons) were used and were overlapped in the same peak at 3.87 ppm (peak 1 of Figure 1). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure ). Although the 3.87 ppm signal was also partially superimposed with the signal from H3 of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) (21), the sensitivity was better than that obtained from the use of the anomeric signal, which was due to just one proton (Figure 2).).\nThe integral values of partially overlapped heparin signals can vary as a function of the magnetic field used, spectral resolution or by the natural structural variability of heparin (22). Moreover, the ANVISA method was designed to distinguish BMH from PMH, while the method discussed here aims to differentiate PMH, BMH, OMH, and BLH. For this reason, we evaluated the signal intensities instead of the integral values. Due to the polyelectrolyte characteristic of heparin, slight differences in the concentration, pH or ionic strength of the heparin solutions can induce small changes in chemical shift values.

Figure 3 shows the acetyl signal of the proton spectra of several PMH samples from two different suppliers, measured in deuterium oxide or in phosphate buffer. The addition of buffer removes the small shifts observed in deuterium oxide, making the spectra more reproducible, and comparable by minimizing pH and ionic strength sources of variation.

The intensities of peaks 1 (3.87 ppm), 2 (3.28 ppm),  and 3 (2.05 ppm) were measured and the ratios 1:2 and 3:2 were calculated (Supplementary Tables 123456). Results, shown in Figure ). Results, shown in Figure 4, indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure , indicate that a ratio of 1:2 clearly distinguishes BMH from the other heparin sources, whereas a ratio of 3:2 differentiates PMH, OMH, and BLH. Accordingly, the scheme presented in Figure 5 can be used to identify heparin types from each group from these ratios: first check the 1:2 ratio is between 1.21 and 1.88, to classify the sample as BMH, otherwise check the 3:2 ratio to decide among PMH, OMH, BLH, or an unknown source.

The limits of Figure 5 correspond to prediction intervals with 99% probability (see Experimental section). The PMH and OMH interval separation was the smallest, confirming the similarity of heparins from these two sources.

Six NMR tubes of the same sample were prepared, and proton spectra were recorded on each sample using 16 or 8 scans, respectively. Results summarized in the Supplementary Table 7 show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans. show that the CV% of both ratios was \u22644% regardless the number of scans.\nA series of 20 BMH, 1 PMH, and 1 BLH provided by USP were analyzed by 1 H-NMR by two independent laboratories. Results obtained on BMH show a good comparability between the ranges and values obtained by the two laboratories (Table 2 and Supplementary Table  and Supplementary Table 8). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45. Both laboratories identified test samples (BLH and PMH) as non-compatible with BMH [r(1:2) \u2264 1]. However, while the BLH sample was correctly identified by both laboratories, laboratory 2 identified the PMH sample as OMH, since r(3:2) value (1.37) was within the range of mucosa ovine heparin. A more detailed analysis of the spectra reveals a lower spectral resolution of the PMH spectrum measured by laboratory 2, confirmed by the different width at half height of TSP between the two spectra (about 1 Hz and 5 Hz, for laboratory 1 and 2, respectively) (Figures ). This was confirmed by a paired t-test on the r(1:2) value of the BMH samples which gave a pvalue of 0.45.

This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.). This confirms that the evaluation of the spectrum resolution using the width half height of the TSP signal is crucial for a correct identification of the heparin sources with the proposed method.", "HSQC Analysis": "Quantitative HSQC was recently applied to heparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for calculating the percentage of monosaccharides and disaccharides by normalizing volumes with reference to the sum of volumes of signals corresponding to each monosaccharide type (glucosamines or uronic acids) and the same carbon proton pair type (17,18). This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources . This validated analytical procedure can be used to assess the quality of industrial production in terms of presence of contaminants or chemical modifications, as well as to compare heparin of different manufacturers or to differentiate heparin of different sources (10).  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables .  The method was applied to all groups of heparins and results are reported in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables 9101112131415161718192021) and summarized in the box plots of Figure ) and summarized in the box plots of Figure 7. Notably, the monosaccharide composition of both glucosamine and uronic acid shows some variability within the same heparin source that is attributed to the natural variability of the starting material and to the different process conditions used by manufacturers to purify heparin from the crudes. However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure .

However, the process related variability is much lower than the differences found among the heparins of different origin (Figure 7). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods ). The strong reduction of 6-O-sulfation of BMH compared to the other heparin sources (GlcNy,6S < 60%), allows to easily differentiate BMH from other heparin types, similar to previously described carbon spectrum integration methods (8)..\nImportantly, differences which were not observable in the 1D proton spectra were clearly detected by the HSQC method. For instance, OMH, PMH, and BLH differ not only in the degree of acetylation of glucosamine residues (PMH>OMH>BLH) but also in the glucuronic acid content and non-sulfated iduronic acid content (PMH>OMH>BLH) (Figure 7). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.). The range of values of the corresponding residues can then be used to distinguish each heparin source.\nA further level of characterization involved the quantification of disaccharide sequences and minor features, such as the heparin biological activity related glucuronic acid linked to 3-Osulfated glucosamine (G-A * ) disaccharide that is a marker of the antithrombin-binding (ATb) pentasaccharide (23)..\nBecause the G-A * sequence was identified exclusively in the active pentasaccharide sequence, G-A * can be considered the marker of the heparin ATb site. The amount of G-A * has a certain variability within each heparin source (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products. In contrast, the G-A * content varies considerably among heparin obtained by different sources. In particular, the highest amount of G-A * was observed in the PMH samples (from 1.9 to 3.4%), while in the other species G-A * was always lower than 1.0 %, with the exception of one ovine sample for which the G-A * value reached 2.8%. Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences ), which together with the molecular weight, may explain potency variability observable in commercial products.

Moreover, in several BMH samples G-A * residue was not detectable (below LOD), possibly due to the presence of alternative AT-binding sequences (10)..\nIn addition, the presence of 2,3-epoxy gluonic acid (epoxide) and galacturonic acid were observed and are known to be formed during the alkali treatment of heparin that occurs during the heparin purification process (24). Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures . Even if epoxide and galacturonic acid residues were not detected in many batches (Supplementary Tables 11, 14, 17, 20; Supplementary Figures 1,2), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra. Notably, 15 of 39 BMH samples contain galacturonic acid ranging from 0.9 to 9.8% and 4 of 39 BMH samples contain epoxide (1.3to 4.8%). These large amounts of chemically modified structures can affect not only the activity of heparin but possibly also the pharmacokinetic and other biological properties and therefore the control of epoxide and galacturonic acid process related impurities levels in the heparin API manufacturing process would be recommended.), some samples contained levels of these unnatural residues which were not observable in proton NMR spectra.

The method developed here, is an alternative to that proposed by ANVISA, that is able not only to distinguish BMH from PMH, but also to confirm that the sample was not manufactured from other heparin sources such as bovine lung or ovine mucosa. The method, based on measurement of a proton NMR spectrum, is not much different from that present in both US and EU pharmacopeias for the identification of PMH heparin. A method utilizing the intensity ratios among selected signals was indeed already used in several pharmacopeia monographs to detect the presence of possible unknown contaminant (7). Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.. Here, a further proposed modification allows more different heparin types from potentially commercially viable animal sources to be distinguished, making clear the source of the product.\nNevertheless, overlapping signals on the proton NMR spectra prevent signals of minor structural signatures to be detected. For example, the presence of epoxidated or galacturonic acid residues cannot be easily observed in 1D proton spectra, while their signals are well resolved in the 2D HSQC spectra. The possibility to use the HSQC spectra, not only to assign 1D superimposed proton signals but also to quantify the relative abundance of each residue of glycosaminoglycans, was recently proposed by different groups (17,18). These groups showed that a single HSQC analysis was able to provide the mono and disaccharide composition of heparin, including detection, and quantification of process related residues (i.e., epoxidation, galacturonic acid, or residues generated by oxidative treatment) (24-26) establish the species and organ source of heparin and detect the presence of possible contaminants. The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis .

The presence and the identification of the contaminant (OSCS) during the heparin crisis was indeed confirmed by HSQC analysis (4)..\nEven if 2D HSQC would be preferable in terms of amount of information obtained, the need for instruments equipped with high sensitivity probes (for example, cryogenically cooled probes) and for operators skilled in NMR, will make the application of the HSQC method difficult for many analytical laboratories. Although lower resolution and containing less information than 2D data sets, 1D proton-NMR data can be used to distinguish heparin types in a facile manner and is very similar to a method that is already required by several pharmacopeias and more widely applicable to an analytical laboratory. However, the increasing sensitivity and accuracy of NMR spectrometers and the availability of software which allows the complete automatization of the spectra processing and analysis have made the HSQC methodology a viable information value added alternative for many laboratories and may become more widely accessible in the future.", "file_name": "1D_and_2D_HSQC_NMR_Two_Methods_to_Distin.grobid.tei.xml", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer_and_corresponding_answers_and_reasons": "1.

All materials were dried in vacuum at room temperature for six hours before use. Handling of the materials, including the preparations of stock and sample solutions, was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in an AtmosBag \u2122 . 1 H NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies 400/64 Premium Shielded spectrometer operating at 400 MHz, and a Bruker ASCEND spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Titrations were performed by adding successively 5 L aliquots of a concentrated titrant solution with a calibrated micropipette into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a solution of a sample compound whose NMR signals were used for probing complexation, with exception of some titration systems. In the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine, weighed solid of the titrant was added directly into an NMR tube filled with 0.5 mL of a capsaicin solution, because the solubility of glucosamine hydrochloride is too low for preparing a concentrated titrant solution. After each addition, the solid was dissolved thoroughly with vigorous shaking at 50 \u00baC for two minutes, and the sample tube was left in the NMR probe until the solution was cooled to\nthe probe temperature before spectrum recording; after the measurement, it was confirmed that no precipitation occurred. A similar method of sample preparation was employed for the titrations of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with capsaicin in D 2 O, because of low watersolubility of the titrant capsaicin. Weighed solid capsaicin was added into an NMR tube loaded with 0.5 mL of a monosaccharide solution. Each mixture was rigorously shaken at 50 \u00baC, and was left in the NMR probe until temperature equilibrium; the absence of any solid was confirmed after NMR measurements. The solubility of capsaicin is even lowered in acidic solution, causing difficulty in some titrations at low pD. The sample and titrant concentrations are described in the legend of each figure that represents a titration curve and also in Supplementary Materials section. The pH of a sample solution was adjusted by using just necessary amounts of solid Na\u2082CO\u2082 and 0.01 % DCl, and pH values measured by a glass electrode calibrated with the standard buffers were converted to pD on the basis of relation pD = pH meas + 0.45 [22].

The chemical shifts \u03b4 are changed with the concentration, as represented in Figure 1 for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure  for selected protons (the NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials section).

The asymptotic increases in \u03b4 with the concentration suggest that glucosamine cations\nassociate with each other to yield aggregates with hydrogen bonding [24][25][26]. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.. Therefore, the self-association has been studied prior to experiments of complexation with capsaicin.\nIn a glucosamine monomer, the NH 3 + group, which is a strong proton donor, constructs a five-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding system together with O(1), as illustrated in The self-association is assumed to be controlled by a single binding constant, which is equivalent to the mean successive association constant K as defined by the following equation.\nHere [Gl k ] is the molar concentration of an aggregate composed of k units of glucosamine (abbreviation Gl is used for the species in DMSO). Since NH 3 + is the only proton-donating group, every aggregate is terminated by an unbound NH 3 + site; i.e., any aggregate composed of n units involves one unassociated NH 3 + site in addition to n -1 sites of associated NH 3 + . The \u03b4 values inherent in these sites are averaged in the fast-exchange case, so that \u03b4 observed for NH 3 + is expressed by the following equation.\nHere \u03b4 as is the \u03b4 inherent in NH 3 + associated with other units in the aggregate, \u03b4 ua is \u03b4 of NH 3 + proton in unassociated monomeric molecule, and the unbound NH 3 + in the aggregate is assumed to carry \u03b4 ua identical with that of monomeric molecule. Least-squares fitting based on Equation 2reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure reproduces well the titration curve of the NH 3 + proton, as shown in Figure 3; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes). The parameters are determined as K as = 490 (230) M -1 , \u03b4 ua = 7.750 (0.041) and \u03b4 as = 8.067 (0.008); the numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations, and M = mol dm -3 . Since \u03b4 ua is determined by extrapolation to C Gl = 0 in a \u03b4 versus C Gl plot, the very sharp \u03b4-change in the low concentration region causes the large uncertainty of \u03b4 ua , which propagates to the standard deviation of K as .; the calculation process is detailed in Section 5.1 (Calculation models and processes).

Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.; the above K as value has been obtained for solutions dried with our maximum efforts. Evidently, glucosamine cations are associated through hydrogen bonds of NH 3 + with various oxygen atoms to form linear aggregates in non-aqueous media.\nSince the oxygen atoms are bound in an irregular manner, Equation 2 is invalid for the OH proton shifts, as the asymptotic titration curves of OH protons show a trend of saturation in a high concentration range as compared with the curve of NH 3 + (Figure 1).).\nThe broken lines in Figure 3  for n = 2.

The pKa of capsaicin has been reported to be 9.76 and 9.93 [33,34]. Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit . Since the acid dissociation constant in D 2 O is larger than that in H 2 O by almost one unit [30,31], capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55. Therefore, a titration at the selected pD gives practically the proper formation constant for each species At pD 9.55, the 1 H NMR signals of the CH(2) and CH(1) protons in both glucosamine isomers show significant shifts upon addition of capsaicin, as represented in Figure , capsaicin is neutral even at pD 9.55.

Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually: show asymptotic decrease which is characteristic of 1:1complexation. Since the coexisting isomers, \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , compete with each other for the complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant of each complex is defined individually:\nIn these expressions, [\u03b1Gl 0 Cp] and [\u03b2Gl 0 Cp] are the molar concentrations of capsaicin complexes with \u03b1-Gl 0 and \u03b2-Gl 0 , respectively. In the fast exchange case, of each isomer is proportional to the mole fraction of the complex.\nHere jC\u03b1 and jC\u03b2 are the j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 values inherent in the signal j of the complexes of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms, respectively. The total concentrations of the isomers, C \u03b1Gl and C \u03b2Gl , were obtained on the basis of the populations determined from the NMR signal intensities. Equations 13 and 14 can be expressed by a function of K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 , individually, as explained in Section 5.2 (Calculation models and processes). Least-squares fittings of j\u03b1 and j\u03b2 have determined the formation constants shown in Table 3. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.. The thermodynamic stability K f\u03b1 of the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is significantly higher than K f\u03b2 of the \u03b2 complex.\nIn the titration of capsaicin with glucosamine at pD 9.55, the aromatic protons shift upfield with line-broadening, as presented in Figure 12, while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table , while the shifts of the aliphatic protons are only of the order of 0.001 (cf. Table S4 in Supplementary Materials).

Complexed capsaicin exhibits proton signals averaged over the complexes of \u03b1and \u03b2-glucosamine, due to the fast exchange. As a consequence, K f\u03b1 and K f\u03b2 cannot be determined individually from the observed monotonic titration curves. The solid lines in Figure .

The solid lines in Figure 13 are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table  are drawn on the basis of the non-competitive 1:1-complexation; K f1 values shown in Table 3 give underestimation for the true formation constant, due to the hydrogen bonds in the complex with glucosamine.

Since hydrogen bonding is ineffective in aqueous media under ordinary conditions, the complexation is supposed to be motivated primarily by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van-der-Waals interaction [35,36,37]. Once reactant molecules are closed to each other, water-free space created between the paired reactant molecules permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between the phenol OH and an oxygen or nitrogen atom in glucosamine so as to stabilize the intermolecular contact; the NH 2 group bearing a well-defined lone-pair is a better counter site of the hydrogen-bonding, as schematically shown in Figure .

Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field . Such hydrogen bonds reduce diamagnetic screening constants at the binding sites in glucosamine, but the phenyl ring of the capsaicin molecule that faces a glucosamine molecule induces a local magnetic field on the glucosamine protons in the direction opposite to the external field [24,38,39]. The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table . The ring-current field is more effective so that the overall \u03b4 values are decreased upon complexation, as confirmed by the negative jC of glucosamine (Table 3). The comparison of the jC values indicates that the closest CH groups to the ring center of capsaicin are CH(1) and CH(2) in the \u03b1-glucosamine complex while CH(2) and CH(3) in the \u03b2-complex (Figure ).

The absolute C values tend to be larger in the \u03b1-complex than in the \u03b2-complex;\nthe former may be in a closer contact in consistency with the larger K f\u03b1 values. In contrast to the aromatic proton of capsaicin, the aliphatic protons, including CH(2) bonded to amide C=O, do not show significant shifts upon complexation (Table S4). Therefore, the amide group does not contribute to the complexation, differing from the complexation in DMSO; the aliphatic chain is located outside of the water-free space constructed by the close contact with glucosamine, so that hydration on the amide group hinders intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with glucosamine.).

In the titration of capsaicin with Nacetylglucosamine, the aromatic protons are shifted with the total concentration of the monosaccharide (Figure 15), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table ), while the absolute values of aliphatic protons are less than 0.002 except CH(1\u00b4) bound to the phenyl group (Table S4). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure ). The titration curves of the aromatic protons are almost linear, suggesting that log K f is not larger than 10 if simple 1:1-complexation is assumable (Figure S6 in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table  in Supplementary Materials). The NMR shifts of N-acetylglucosamine by addition of capsaicin are also too small to elucidate the complexation (Table S3). A novel phenomena found in the titration is that the populations of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms are changed in the presence of capsaicin: \u03b1 form is the majority with a population of 0.66 until the concentration This observation suggests indirectly the presence of hyperconjugative interactions operative at the anomeric carbon, although the interaction is too weak to form a complex with a definite composition.

Obviously, the capsaicin complex of GlH + is much less stable than that of Gl 0 , as a result of protonation on the amino group: the NH 3 + group weakens the solvent-exclusion effect because of a stronger interaction with water molecules, and also it is incapable of working as proton-accepting site towards the phenol OH of capsaicin. This fact supports the crucial role of NH 2 in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine Gl 0 .", "Conclusion": "Protonation and self-association equilibria of glucosamine as well as its complexation with capsaicin have been studied by 1 H NMR titrations, which are interpreted by formulation suitable for every equilibrium model. Both D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine present quite different complexation modes in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Especially, the complexation of glucosamine is sensitive to the environments, such as pH in aqueous media.\nIn DMSO, glucosamine cations undergo self-association with intermolecular binding between NH 3 + and OH sites. The resulting linear aggregates composed of various numbers of units react with capsaicin to form a pseudo-1:1-complex with formation constant of ca. 30 M -1 ; the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding illustrated in Figure 6 Protonation on the amino nitrogen drastically decreases the stability of the complexes, supporting the crucial role of NH 2 groups in the complexation of deprotonated glucosamine. The formation constants conclude that the \u03b1-glucosamine complex is thermodynamically more stable than the \u03b2-complex; the chemical shifts of glucosamine protons suggest that the intermolecular contact is closer in the \u03b1-complex, in consistency with the higher thermodynamic stability. This clear difference between the isomers is ascribable to the steric and stereoelectronic effects at the anomeric carbon. Neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 form of N-acetylglucosamine yields a complex as stable as deprotonated glucosamine, as a result of conversion of amino to amide groups.

The glucosamine unit, rather than the N-acetylglucosamine unit, is predicated to play a major role in interaction with capsaicin.

This process mediates many important aspects of cell-cell recognition, such as inflammation, cell differentiation, tumor cell colonization and metastasis. In addition, the carbohydrate structures, which decorate the cell surface of higher organisms, change with the onset of cancer and inflammation, representing highly promising targets for new and more-selective anticancer drugs and for early diagnosis. However, due to its complexity and weak binding affinities, carbohydrate recognition by natural systems is still poorly understood. On the other hand, studies of synthetic carbohydrate receptors could make significant contributions to a better understanding of this process and lead to the development of new chemotherapeutics and chemosensors.

This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms . This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms [3,[7][8][9]. Binding of an individual lectin to a monosaccharide substrate is extremely weak; the dissociation constants (K d ) for these complexes are typically in the 0.1-10 mM range. This is largely due to the solvent-exposed nature of the lectin binding sites, which make few direct contacts with monosaccharide substrate.

Binding is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and van der Waals packing of the hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains forming sandwich-type interactions.\nAlthough many interesting synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in organic solvent have been developed [2], the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages. A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak. One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules , the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages.

One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules [5]. These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin . These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin [6], calixarene , calixarene [7], porphyrin , porphyrin [8] or cage-type molecules  or cage-type molecules [9] showed that it is possible to design and synthesize artificial receptors for binding carbohydrates in water, although stabilities of their complexes are weak. These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P.

These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P. Davis et al. represents another interesting approach in the design of artificial carbohydrate receptors [10]. This molecule can bind selectively all-equatorial disaccharides such as cellobiose in water within the range of values reported for lectins. As in previously mentioned examples, hydrophobic attractions supported by CH-interactions are the driving forces for the binding of disaccharides. In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation .

In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation [2b, 11]. Boronic acid is known to react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of carbohydrates to form five or six-membered cyclic esters in basic aqueous media. However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation.

However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation. Recently it was shown that receptors designed from condensed polypyridine units [12] display very strong and selective binding of various carbohydrates in organic solvents, including polar methanol, mainly through formation of hydrogen bonds.

Therefore, condensed polypyridines present attractive building blocks for construction of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules.\nWe report here the design, synthesis and binding properties of 1,8-naphthyridine based acyclic 1, bi-bracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic 3 receptor, Fig. (1), molecules toward the various monosaccharide substrates in aqueous buffer at pH 6.5.

Our synthetic receptors are relatively small, have the desired threedimensional structure, hydrogen-bonding site and lipophilic binding pocket to promote hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.", "RECEPTOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES": "Macrocyclic structures are particularly useful for design of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules mainly because they are large enough to contain a spherical binding site (lipophylic cavity) of appropriate size and shape. Incorporation of condensed polypyridine units into such macrocyclic structure could result in construction of artificial receptors capable of selective carbohydrate binding in water through combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, condensed polypyridine compounds exhibit strong absorption and fluorescence emission bands, and complexation induced changes in their absorption or fluorescence spectra will allow for the determination of the stability constants.\nTo demonstrate the suitability of macrocyclic polypyridine structures for design of artificial receptors capable of binding carbohydrate substrates in water, we synthesized three types of 1,8naphthyridine based receptor molecules 1-3, Fig. (1)..\n1,8-Naphthyridine moiety has been successfully used in design of receptors for monosaccharide binding in organic solvents [12e,f], and there is strong literature evidence demonstrating that replacement of pyridine or pyrimidine with naphthyridine core moiety in some acyclic carbohydrate receptors resulted in a significant enhancement of the receptor's binding properties [12f]. However, this monosaccharide binding motif remains largely unexploited in the design and synthesis of receptors for binding and recognition of these important biological substrates in water. Synthesized bibracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic receptor 3 possess a 1,8-naphthyridine core moiety bridged with two flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amines (TREN). In these receptors, two adjacent pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as the proton acceptors (AA), while lateral TREN secondary amines function as the proton donors (DD). The relay of hydroxyl groups in monosaccharides offers an ADDA motif complementary to the DAAD array of naphthyridine receptors to form multiple H-bonds [13]. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.", "SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECEPTORS 1-3": "1,8-Naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4, a key receptor intermediate, was synthesized over five steps as previously reported [14]. Condensation of 1,8-naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4 with an equimolar amount of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) followed by treatment with NaBH 4 yields a mixture of receptors 2 (30%) and 3 (15%), Scheme 1. However, if the 2:3 ratio of 4 and TREN is used, the major product formed is receptor 3 (45%) while 2 cannot be detected. In both cases pure 2 and 3 were obtained after RP-HPLC purification of crude reaction mixtures. Compound 1 was prepared for control studies by condensation of 4 with two equivalents of propylamine using the same synthetic strategy. After solvent evaporation, the oily residue was redissolved in water containing 0.1 % TFA, and the final product 1 was purified by RP-HPLC. The product 1 was obtained in 60% yield.

Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells [15], we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies. The pK a values obtained for aromatic, terti- ary, secondary and primary nitrogens of receptor 2 were 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, and 10.7, respectively. In the case of UV/vis experiments, lowering the pH of the receptor 2 solution from 11 to 8 caused a decrease of the absorption intensity at 315 nm, while further lowering the pH of the solution from 8 to 1 resulted in the opposite effect. In this case, the absorption intensity increased with a bathochromic shift of the maximum wavelength ( max =319 nm, pH 1), associated with the formation of an isosbestic point at 274 nm. Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds , we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5.

Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds [16] indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39)  indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39) [17]. Based on these experiments, we can assume that at pH 6.5 in receptors 1-3 only lateral TREN primary and secondary amines will be protonated, allowing desired DAAD H-bonding arrangement for optimal interactions with monosaccharide substrates. The repulsive interactions between positively charged TREN bridges may be expected to prevent complete self-stacking of 1,8-naphthiridine units in both receptors 2 and 3 thus creating a hydrophobic binding pocket. Although the TREN bridges in both macrocyclic receptors are flexible enough to allow the binding pocket to adjust to carbohydrate substrate for optimal interactions, a greater degree of structural flexibility and conformational adaptability may be expected for the receptor 2. Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions..

As expected, comparison of the UV/vis spectra of reference compound 1 and receptors 2 and 3 taken in an aqueous buffer (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c buffer = 0.05 M, c 1 = 2 10 -4 M, max 1= 312 nm, 1 = 4725.7 M -1 cm -1 , c 2 = 10 -4 M, max 2= 315 nm, 2 = 7372.5 M -1 cm -1 , c 3 = 6.7 10 -5 , max 3= 316 nm, 3 = 13713.0 M -1 cm -1 ), shows a hypochromicity ( 3 <3 1, 2 <2 1 ), an absorption band broadening and bathochromic shift for 2 and 3. Observed effects are indicative of the presence of weak intramolecular -stacking interactions between the 1,8naphthyridine units; strong stacking interactions are reported to produce more pronounced hypochromicity and bathochromic shift [16a,c]. In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M.\nIn contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2). An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer . An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table ). All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table 1, receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution. Affinities toward neutral substrates are much lower and thus not determinable by fluorescence or UV/vis titration experiments under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharides mainly through charge-charge interactions and that hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions play a negligible role or no role in the complex stabilization. In support of this, no significant differences in affinities of receptor 3 toward negatively charged substrates was observed. Obtained results can be explained by the lack of flexible 2-aminoethyl \"arms\" in receptor 3 and somewhat more sterically hindered binding pocket so that complete substrate encapsulation cannot occur. On the other hand, the conformationally more flexible receptor 2 showed millimolar affinities toward neutral hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose, as well as negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and sialic acid. However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table , receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution.

These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.\nIn order to examine the role of hydrogen bonds in stabilization of the complexes, various neutral pyranose and deoxy-pyranose   substrates were investigated. Among these substrates, receptor 2 shows binding preferences for glucose over deoxy-glucose substrates (Table 1) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose. As in previous cases, the stability constants for these complexes also were not determinable by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration experiments. This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability.

We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5). Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.. Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.\nA similar trend in fluorescence intensity was observed for the titration of 3 with negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. An extensive literature search resulted in only one example of artificial receptors capable of discriminating between closely related monosaccharides in aqueous solutions. Cu(II)-coordinated glucose-imprinted poly(acrilate) receptor, reported by S. Striegler [21], has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation , has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation [18] can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities.\nThe observed 1:1 stoichiometry for complexes of 2 and 3 with monosaccharide substrates and the fact that the stability constants for 1 are very low and thus not determinable by UV/vis or fluorescence titrations indicate that complexation occurs by insertion of the substrate molecule into each receptor's lipophilic pocket. Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6). The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. . The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M.

The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis. Also, due to lower sensitivity of the NMR experiment, higher mM concentrations of receptor 2 and sialic acid had to be used. However, at these concentrations the complex precipitation was observed, preventing the utilization of obtained 1 H-NMR chemical shifts for the K d determination..

The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes .
