Merr. (soybean) have strikingly different rates of water imbibition. Seeds that readily imbibe water are termed 'soft' while those that remain non-permeable, even after several days in water, are referred to as 'hard', 'stone', or 'impermeable' seeds. What prevents soybean hard seeds from taking up water? Previous work established that the initial imbibition of soft soybean seeds correlates with the presence of small cracks in the outermost cuticle that covers the seed coat, prompting a detailed analysis of soybean seed coat cutin. In the present paper, it is shown that the outermost cuticle of the seed coat has an unusual chemical composition, lacking typical mid-chain hydroxylated fatty acids but being relatively rich in other types of hydroxylated fatty acids. The cuticle of the impermeable cultivar studied contained a disproportionately high amount of hydroxylated fatty acids relative to that of the permeable ones. Moreover, a brief treatment with hot alkali released the v-hydroxy fatty acid component of the outermost cuticle and created holes in it that caused the seeds to become permeable. This demonstrates that the outermost cuticle of the seed is the critical structure that prevents water uptake by hard seeds.\\n\\nSoybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) has enormous commercial value as it is the world's largest oilseed and legume crop, and is the primary source of protein feed supplement for livestock. Many soybean cultivars have been selected for seeds that imbibe water rapidly and uniformly but even these varieties produce some hard seeds (also known as 'stone' or 'impermeable' seeds). Such seeds do not readily imbibe water when soaked, even for prolonged periods. Other varieties, many of which possess otherwise desirable agronomic traits, produce a large proportion of hard seeds (Rolston, 1978). And while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years . And while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years (Tyler, 1997), they constitute a major problem during food processing where rapid and uniform hydration is important for the production of quality soybean foods such as soymilk, tofu, and miso.

Understanding the basis for hard seed impermeability to water is an essential first step in developing strategies to handle such seeds on a large scale at the processing stage, and to plan suitable genetic modifications.\\nWhether a legume seed will be soft (permeable) or hard (impermeable) is controlled by the seed coat. This layer, largely derived from the integuments of the maternal tissue after fertilization (Esau, 1977;Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995), embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy , embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy (Bewley and Black, 1994;Baskin et al., 2000).

The seed coat is modified at the hilum and micropyle areas (Fig. .

In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig.  and, thus, will not be considered here. In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig. 1B), the outermost layer consists of closely packed macrosclereids (palisade cells), which are dead cells with uneven wall thickenings. Within their walls is the 'light line', a callose-rich wall area running parallel to the edge of the seed coat ), the outermost layer consists of closely packed macrosclereids (palisade cells), which are dead cells with uneven wall thickenings. Within their walls is the 'light line', a callose-rich wall area running parallel to the edge of the seed coat (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993;Ma et al., 2004). The next cell layer consists of osteosclereids (hourglass cells). These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm. There is one intact, closely packed, uniseriate layer (herein termed aleurone) with many living cells . The next cell layer consists of osteosclereids (hourglass cells). These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm. There is one intact, closely packed, uniseriate layer (herein termed aleurone) with many living cells (Yaklich et al., 1992;Ma et al., 2004) as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells. Two thin (<0.2 lm) and inconspicuous cuticles are associated with the seed coat, one on the outside of the seed (covering the palisade cells; Fig.  as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells. Two thin (<0.2 lm) and inconspicuous cuticles are associated with the seed coat, one on the outside of the seed (covering the palisade cells; Fig. 1C), and the other between the crushed parenchyma and endosperm ), and the other between the crushed parenchyma and endosperm (Chamberlin et al., 1994;Ma et al., 2004)..\\nVarious explanations have been advanced to account for the strikingly different permeabilities of the coats to water in hard and soft seeds. Some examples are: tightly bound palisade cells (Corner, 1951;Ballard, 1973), thickened coat , thickened coat (Wyatt, 1977;Miao et al., 2001), lack of pits , lack of pits (Yaklich et al., 1986;Harris, 1987;Hahalis et al., 1996;Chachalis and Smith, 2001), presence of endocarp deposits , presence of endocarp deposits (Calero et al., 1981;Yaklich et al., 1986), dark colour , dark colour (Wyatt, 1977), closed hilum and/or micropyle , closed hilum and/or micropyle (Hyde, 1954;Ballard, 1973;Rolston, 1978;Lush and Evans, 1980), outer tangential walls of palisade cells , outer tangential walls of palisade cells (Werker et al., 1979), and a prominent light line of the palisade cells , and a prominent light line of the palisade cells (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Harris, 1987;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993).

Generally, the cuticles of the seed coat were overlooked, in part because they are very thin and do not stain readily for lipids as does a typical cuticle. However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat .

However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat (Ma et al., 2004).

These cracks were present in soft but not hard seeds. The initial penetration of water into soft seeds typically occurred on the dorsal side, the location of the majority of the cracks (Ma et al., 2004). The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.. The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.\\nIn the present study, the idea that the continuity of the outermost cuticle governs water entry into soybean seeds was confirmed experimentally. This brought up the question of why the cuticles crack in some seeds (making them soft) but not in others (making them hard). According to Ma et al. (2004), isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds. Could this property be related to the chemical composition of the cuticle? To date, no detailed analysis of any seed coat cuticle has been carried out. Accordingly, the monomer composition of both the outer and inner cuticles of a number of soybean cultivars, including those that produce predominantly soft seeds and one that produces predominantly hard seeds, was characterized. These results were further compared with the monomer compositions of cuticles from pods and leaves of the same plants. The effect of wax extraction from the outer cuticle on water imbibition by hard seeds was also determined, as wax is known to be the major contributor of hydrophobicity in leaf cuticles , isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds.

All seeds were stored at room temperature until they were used. Fully expanded soybean leaves and full-sized, green pods were collected approximately 40 d post-anthesis.\\n\\nSeeds were examined initially with a dissecting microscope, and only those with no visible damage were chosen for imbibition trials. Water uptake of at least five individual seeds from each cultivar or experimental treatment was measured gravimetrically according to Ma et al. (2004)..\\n\\nIt was not possible to devise a method to remove the entire outer cuticle from a seed. However, it was possible to remove small patches of this cuticle by boiling seeds individually in 1 M NaOH for 5 min (modified from Beresniewicz et al., 1995). The alkali was removed by rinsing three times with water. Control seeds were either untreated or boiled in water for 5 min. Seeds that had split during the boiling procedures were discarded; the rest were tested for water uptake or were observed for any changes in the seed coat surface. Additionally, the NaOH solubles released from treated seeds were pooled, acidified, and extracted with CHCl 3 . These solubles were then dried, derivatized, and analysed by GC-FID/GC-MS as described for surface waxes below.. The alkali was removed by rinsing three times with water.

The CHCl 3 -soluble waxes thus extracted were evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 40 °C. The residue was quantitatively transferred to a glass vial and the solvent removed under a stream of nitrogen. After addition of a known quantity of tetracosane (as an internal standard) the dried samples were derivatized according to Riederer and Scho ¨nherr (1986). The combined methyl ester and trimethylsilyl ether derivatives were analysed by GC on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and an ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The GC was equipped with a pair of CP-Sil 5 CB low-bleed MS columns (WCOT silica 30 m3 0.25 mm ID), one in line with the FID and the other with the MS. The injector ovens were set at 250 °C, and the FID oven at 300 °C. Samples (1 ll) were injected twice (once to each column) in splitless mode and simultaneously eluted with the following oven temperature programme: the initial temperature of 80 °C was held for 2 min, followed by a rapid increase (40 °C min À1 ) to 200 °C, a 2 min hold at 200 °C, and a slower increase (3 °Cmin À1 )to300°C. The final temperature was held for just over 9 min for a total run time of 50 min. High purity He was used as a carrier gas at 1 ml min À1 . Compounds were identified on the basis of their co-elution with authentic standards and their EI-mass spectra (50-650 amu). Quantification was based on FID peak areas and independently derived calibration curves for each standard..

While still wet, the coats were partially digested with pectinase so that the outer cuticle and its associated cells could be separated from the inner cuticle with its associated cells. This paradermal separation was achieved by modifying the method of Pacchiano et al. (1993). Briefly, seed coats were first treated with 1.6 mg ml À1 pectinase (from Aspergillus niger,2 5Um g À1 ; Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0) for 2 d at 31 °C. At this stage, a seed coat could be separated with forceps into an outer layer (mainly palisade and hourglass cells) and an inner layer (largely crushed parenchyma and aleurone). Alternatively, the two layers of soybean seed coats were separated after a 2 h treatment with boiling oxalic acid/oxalate solution (4 g l À1 oxalic acid, 16 g l À1 ammonium oxalate; .

From these curves it is clear that seeds from five cultivars (AC Onrei, Bobcat, Harosoy 63, Harovinton, Tachanagaha) can be categorized as soft (with varying degrees of permeability). By contrast, hard seeds selected from cv. OX-951 failed to imbibe any measurable amount of water..

First, a brief (30 s) immersion in CHCl 3 was used to extract readily soluble waxes. However, this failed to make the stone seeds imbibe (Fig. 2B). (The extent of wax removal from the outer cuticle was judged to be nearly complete based on subsequent exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats; see below.) Next, endocarp deposits (material from the inner face of the pod that can adhere to the seed coat surface; ). (The extent of wax removal from the outer cuticle was judged to be nearly complete based on subsequent exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats; see below.) Next, endocarp deposits (material from the inner face of the pod that can adhere to the seed coat surface; Gijzen et al., 1999; Fig. ; Fig. 1D) were selectively removed from the surface of intact seeds by a brief treatment with a cellulase-pectinase mixture. Again, no change in permeability was observed (data not shown). Then, intact seeds were treated with pancreatic lipase for 20 h at room temperature. This treatment released predominantly 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids (approximately 26% of that released from the outer cuticle by BF 3 / MeOH depolymerization), albeit without any effect on permeability (data not shown). Success was ultimately achieved by boiling the seeds in 1 M NaOH for 5 min. This alkaline treatment had a striking effect on the ability of hard seeds to take up water, i.e. treated seeds imbibed quickly and hydrated as efficiently as the soft seeds (Fig. ) were selectively removed from the surface of intact seeds by a brief treatment with a cellulase-pectinase mixture.

This browning was probably due to oxidation of cell wall phenols exposed by de-esterification of some of the cuticle monomer components. Patchy removal of the cuticle was observed microscopically with ultraviolet light, under which dark spots of various sizes, some merging with Fig. ).

Initial analysis of whole seed coat cutin by BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization revealed the presence of fatty acids, 2-hydroxy fatty acids, and xhydroxy fatty acids as the major components. No midchain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids typical of many plant cutins (Walton, 1990;Matzke and Riederer, 1991;Kolattukudy, 2000) were detected (Fig.  were detected (Fig. 5A). This unusual cutin chemistry was contrasted with that of cuticles isolated from either soybean leaves or green pods which, after BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization, revealed a typical profile of cutin monomers including substantial amounts of 9(10),16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acids (Fig. ).

Consequently, BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization was used for all remaining cutin analyses.\\nTo determine which components of the cuticle had been removed by boiling in NaOH as described above (Figs 3,4), the aliphatics present in the NaOH hydrolysate were analysed. The aliphatic cutin monomer compounds consisted of fatty acids, 1-alkanols, n-alkanes, and x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table , the aliphatics present in the NaOH hydrolysate were analysed. The aliphatic cutin monomer compounds consisted of fatty acids, 1-alkanols, n-alkanes, and x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table 1). Interestingly, little of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid component observed with whole seed coat analyses (Fig. ). Interestingly, little of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid component observed with whole seed coat analyses (Fig. 5A) was released by NaOH treatment. Analysis of the aliphatic monomers derived from the remaining inner and outer seed coat cuticles (isolated from NaOH-treated seeds) revealed additional fatty acids, 2hydroxy acids, and smaller amounts of x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table ) was released by NaOH treatment. Analysis of the aliphatic monomers derived from the remaining inner and outer seed coat cuticles (isolated from NaOH-treated seeds) revealed additional fatty acids, 2hydroxy acids, and smaller amounts of x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table 1).).\\nNext, complete chemical analyses of the soluble wax from the outer cuticle, and the cutins from both the inner and outer cuticles (isolated and analysed separately) from permeable and impermeable seeds were made (Tables 234). From this information, it was possible to confirm that only the outer cuticle had been affected by the NaOH treatment (see below).).

The cutin monomers of the inner and outer seed coats of NaOH-treated seeds were analysed after BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization as described in Materials and methods. Values (ng mm À2 seed surface area) represent the average of triplicate measurements 6SD.\\n\\nCHCl 3 :MeOH and CHCl 3 did not yield any greater amount of n-alkanes or 1-alkanols (indicative of wax components) than that obtained from a brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table 2), indicating that the latter treatment was sufficient to remove both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes from soybean seed coat cuticles.), indicating that the latter treatment was sufficient to remove both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes from soybean seed coat cuticles.\\nOuter cuticle: Depolymerization of the extractive-free (i.e. previously exhaustively extracted with CHCl 3 :MeOH and CHCl 3 alone to remove soluble components) outer layer of soybean seed coats using BF 3 /MeOH resulted in the release of fatty acids, 2-hydroxy fatty acids, and xhydroxy fatty acids as the major components (Fig. 5A; Table ; Table 3).

Although the total amounts of cutin monomers released were not directly correlated with imbibition, the least permeable cultivar, OX-951, contained the largest amount of outer cutin monomers among the six cultivars tested. In addition, the monomer profile from seed coats of cv. OX-951 was significantly different in amount with respect to the hydroxylated fatty acid sub-classes from all other soybean cultivars tested. This relationship is clearly evident in the calculated ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids (Table  were detected.

No mid-chain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids, typical of many plant cutins ). No mid-chain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids, typical of many plant cutins (Walton, 1990;Matzke and Riederer, 1991;Kolattukudy, 2000), were detected. By contrast to the data obtained for outer seed coat cuticles, there were no statistical differences between any monomer class isolated from the inner cuticle of the hard and soft seeds tested. Moreover, the ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids were lower (1:0.5) than that from the outer cuticle and did not differ between cultivars (Table , were detected. By contrast to the data obtained for outer seed coat cuticles, there were no statistical differences between any monomer class isolated from the inner cuticle of the hard and soft seeds tested. Moreover, the ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids were lower (1:0.5) than that from the outer cuticle and did not differ between cultivars (Table 4).).\\n\\nTo determine whether the 2-hydroxy fatty acids observed in soybean seed coat cutin depolymerizates were sphingolipid-or cutin-derived, soybean seed coats were subjected to standard sphingolipid analysis (Cahoon and Lynch, 1991;Bonaventure et al., 2003). For comparison, living endosperm tissue from soybean seeds was also analysed. Thus, when the fatty acid components of the sphingolipid fraction isolated from soybean seed endosperm were analysed by GC-MS, the predominant (>95%) 2-hydroxy fatty acid observed was 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (Fig. . For comparison, living endosperm tissue from soybean seeds was also analysed. Thus, when the fatty acid components of the sphingolipid fraction isolated from soybean seed endosperm were analysed by GC-MS, the predominant (>95%) 2-hydroxy fatty acid observed was 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (Fig. 6), with minor amounts of 2-hydroxylated 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids. These data are in agreement with those of ), with minor amounts of 2-hydroxylated 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids. These data are in agreement with those of Sullards et al. (2000). Similarly, a sphingoid base peak was found in the long chain base fraction isolated after sphingosine hydrolysis (Fig. . Similarly, a sphingoid base peak was found in the long chain base fraction isolated after sphingosine hydrolysis (Fig. 6). By contrast, there was no phospholipid band apparent on the TLC plates of lipid extracts prepared from soybean seed coats. Nevertheless, the region of the TLC plate corresponding to phospholipids band (i.e. that which would contain sphingolipids if they were present) was isolated and subjected to hydrolysis and GC analysis. Essentially no components consistent with either 2-hydroxy fatty acids or sphingoid bases were present in the sample (Fig. ).

Regardless of their source (i.e. wax, inner or outer seed coat) all six cultivars studied had essentially the same distribution of monomers (data not shown) and these are summarized for cultivar OX-951 (Table 5). Consequently, the differences in cutin composition between cultivars lay primarily in the quantity of different aliphatic substance classes and not the presence or absence of specific components.). Consequently, the differences in cutin composition between cultivars lay primarily in the quantity of different aliphatic substance classes and not the presence or absence of specific components.\\n\\nThe results presented herein provide direct experimental evidence that the inconspicuous, outermost cuticle of a soybean seed governs its initial ability to imbibe water, a necessary prerequisite for full hydration and seed germination. Selective removal of patches of the outer cuticle with hot alkali did render the seeds capable of imbibition. In accordance with this premise, when areas of the outer cuticle were removed by hot alkali treatment, seeds were changed from hard to soft. This experimental result is consistent with an earlier anatomical study showing that soft seeds of soybean have naturally occurring, minute cracks in their outer cuticle whereas hard seeds do not (Ma et al., 2004). Knowing that it is the integrity of the outer cuticle that is responsible for hard-seededness in soybean will enable steps to be taken in the food processing industry to solve this problem, for example, scarifying seeds prior to soaking.. Knowing that it is the integrity of the outer cuticle that is responsible for hard-seededness in soybean will enable steps to be taken in the food processing industry to solve this problem, for example, scarifying seeds prior to soaking.\\nWhat components of the intact outer cuticle are responsible for its impermeability to water?\\nIn comparing the profile of wax monomers collected by CHCl 3 dip (Table 2) to that of monomers released by brief NaOH treatment (Table ) to that of monomers released by brief NaOH treatment (Table 1), it becomes clear that the NaOH treatment also removed waxes, since there are roughly equal amounts of 1-alkanols and n-alkanes in both samples. The main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.), it becomes clear that the NaOH treatment also removed waxes, since there are roughly equal amounts of 1-alkanols and n-alkanes in both samples. The main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.\\nThe origin of the additional fatty acids and x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH solubles appears to be exclusively from the outer cuticle since the chemical composition of the inner cuticle remained essentially unchanged by the alkali treatment (compare inner seed coat data for OX-951 seeds in Tables 1 and and4). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table ). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table 1) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table ) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table 2) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table ) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table 3). These data confirm that the brief surface treatment with NaOH acted only on the outer cuticle as expected. The (apparent) selective removal of x-hydroxy fatty acids by the NaOH treatment may be due, in part, to the more labile nature of alkyl esters of primary alcohols compared with either alkyl esters of secondary alcohols or alkyl esters in which there is a neighbouring a-hydroxyl group (whether it is involved in an ester or not), as may be the case for 2-OH-fatty acids. Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. ). These data confirm that the brief surface treatment with NaOH acted only on the outer cuticle as expected. The (apparent) selective removal of x-hydroxy fatty acids by the NaOH treatment may be due, in part, to the more labile nature of alkyl esters of primary alcohols compared with either alkyl esters of secondary alcohols or alkyl esters in which there is a neighbouring a-hydroxyl group (whether it is involved in an ester or not), as may be the case for 2-OH-fatty acids. Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. 2B), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components. That both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were removed by this brief exposure to solvent is supported by the observation that exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats did not yield more wax-associated components (i.e. alkanes and 1-alkanols) than brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table ), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components. That both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were removed by this brief exposure to solvent is supported by the observation that exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats did not yield more wax-associated components (i.e. alkanes and 1-alkanols) than brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table 2), although a 3-fold higher yield of fatty acids was obtained.), although a 3-fold higher yield of fatty acids was obtained.\\nThe latter are likely to have originated from the exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats, in which underlying cells, that would not have been accessible to the solvent used for surface wax dissolution, were exposed. This result is in contrast to those obtained from leaf cuticles, for which the intracuticular wax component has been shown to be responsible for its impermeable nature (Scho ¨nherr, 1982), albeit to varying degrees. The amount of wax associated with soybean seed coats (approximately 25 ng mm À2 ) is relatively low compared with that of soybean leaf cuticles (e.g. 99.663.2 ng mm À2 extracted from 13-d-old leaves by CHCl 3 dip) and the cuticle from which they were extracted much thinner. It is plausible, therefore, to assume that brief solvent extraction of the thin outer seed coat cuticle was sufficient to remove the bulk of the soluble waxes (i.e. both epiand intra-cuticular), even though this would not be possible with thicker leaf cuticles., albeit to varying degrees.

It is plausible, therefore, to assume that brief solvent extraction of the thin outer seed coat cuticle was sufficient to remove the bulk of the soluble waxes (i.e. both epiand intra-cuticular), even though this would not be possible with thicker leaf cuticles.\\n\\nThe present findings show that both the inner and outer cuticles of soybean seed coats are unique in chemical composition and that they differ significantly from typical cuticles, including those from leaves and pods of the same plant. This is especially evident in (i) the predominance of 2-hydroxy-and x-hydroxy-fatty acids, (ii) the absence of mid-chain hydroxylated fatty acids (Fig. 5; ; Walton, 1990;Kolattukudy, 2000), and (iii) the high proportion of long chain (non-wax) monomers in the monomer profile of the seed cuticle (Table , and (iii) the high proportion of long chain (non-wax) monomers in the monomer profile of the seed cuticle (Table 5).).\\nThe presence of substantial amounts of 2-hydroxy fatty acids in the present cutin depolymerizates was surprising. The seed coats from imbibed seeds were separated into inner and outer layers. The layers were extracted and analysed separately as described in the legends to Tables 2 and and3      16:0,18:0,20:0,22:0,24:0,25:0,27:0,28:0,29:0,31:0,32:0   Minor (<10%): 20:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0   Minor (<10%): 19:0,20:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0   Traces:  17:0,18:1,18:2,19:0 While this class of compounds has recently been reported as a component of Arabidopsis leaf cuticle  While this class of compounds has recently been reported as a component of Arabidopsis leaf cuticle (Franke et al., 2005), its origin remains uncertain. That is, the 2-hydroxy fatty acids reported for Arabidopsis cutins may have arisen from sphingolipids of the plasma membranes of underlying tissue. However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that the 2-hydroxy fatty acids identified in soybean seed coat cutin depolymerizates are derived from cutin: (i) the preparation from which the outer cuticle aliphatic monomer profile was obtained consisted of dead cells (mainly palisade and hourglass cells), which are unlikely to contain plasma membrane-derived lipids , its origin remains uncertain.

These data confirm that the 2-hydroxy fatty acids found in soybean seed coat cutin depolymerizates are derived from the cutin polymer.

In addition, , the difference between hard and soft soybean seeds is the continuity of the outermost seed cuticle in the former and the presence of small cracks in the cuticles of the latter. In addition, Ma et al. (2004) reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds. Thus, the strength of the cutin polymer may be critical to forming one or the other type of seed. There are chemical differences between the components of the outermost cuticles of hard and soft seeds, and these differences may have a bearing on the tendency of cuticles to crack. In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability. reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds.

In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability.\\nAlthough a direct study of the cutin polymer was not possible, the monomer compositions of the two seed types showed intriguing differences. The most notable of these was the relatively high amount of hydroxylated components (especially 2-hydroxy fatty acids) found in the BF 3 /MeOH depolymerizate of hard seeds. The presence of a greater proportion of bi-functional (hydroxylated) fatty acids may provide a greater inter-connectivity between monomers in the cutin of hard seeds. And while bi-functional monomers themselves are not sufficient for the assembly of an integrated, three-dimensional polymer, recent evidence suggests that glycerol plays a significant role in the polyester structure of cutins (Grac xa et al., 2002) and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers. and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers.\\nThe relevance of the hydroxylated monomers is also underscored by the results of the NaOH treatment of entire hard seeds, in which the x-hydroxy fatty acid component of the outer cuticle (along with part of the fatty acid component) was extracted (compare Tables 1 and and3).

This resulted in the disruption of the outer cuticle structure in discrete areas, allowing the seed to imbibe. Although the NaOH treatment resulted in removal of only patches of cuticle (Figs 3,4), it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables , it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables 1 and and3); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions. In any case, it is clear that x-hydroxy fatty acids play an integral role in establishing or stabilizing the overall cutin structure, possibly making it resistant to cracking in the case of hard seeds. It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions.

It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.\\nNevertheless, the interaction between cutin monomers and the underlying carbohydrate cell wall matrix cannot be overlooked in establishing the differences between hard and soft soybean seeds. Indeed, preliminary evidence suggests that the structural organization of outer seed coats differs between hard-and soft-seeded cultivars (MA Bernards, S Shao, unpublished results). For example, after exhaustive enzymatic digestion with cellulase, pectinase, and hemicellulase, the amount of cutin in the outer seed coats of both Harosoy 63 and OX-951 remains <1% dry weight (data not shown). The remaining >99% is likely to be residual carbohydrates not digested by the enzymes. However, when subjected to neutral sugar analysis (Blakeney et al., 1983), approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates. The remaining 10-33% of the digested seed coats are likely to contain cutin monomers (approximately 1%), galacturonic acid (not detected in the present analysis), and possibly carbohydrate-aliphatic adducts. The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with , approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates.

The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with Mullin and Xu (2001). Together these data suggest the possibility that a more extensive integration (possibly due to covalent linkages) exists between cutin and carbohydrate monomers in the OX-951 cultivar, which may give the surface material either more structural integrity or greater flexibility, making it less susceptible to cracking and thereby less permeable. This idea requires further testing..

(2004) demonstrates that hardseededness in soybean can be ascribed to the presence of an unbroken, outer cuticle covering the seed. The outer seed cuticle differs from the inner cuticle in chemical composition, and both are strikingly different from cuticles isolated from pods and leaves of the same plant. The feature of the outer cuticle that correlates with a lack of cuticular cracks is a relatively high level of hydroxylated fatty acids. It is postulated that these chemicals are critical in modifying either the degree of cross-linking of the components of the cuticle or its integration with the underlying cell wall components, thereby preventing the cuticle from cracking during development. demonstrates that hardseededness in soybean can be ascribed to the presence of an unbroken, outer cuticle covering the seed.

Merr. (soybean) have strikingly different rates of water imbibition. Seeds that readily imbibe water are termed 'soft' while those that remain non-permeable, even after several days in water, are referred to as 'hard', 'stone', or 'impermeable' seeds. What prevents soybean hard seeds from taking up water? Previous work established that the initial imbibition of soft soybean seeds correlates with the presence of small cracks in the outermost cuticle that covers the seed coat, prompting a detailed analysis of soybean seed coat cutin. In the present paper, it is shown that the outermost cuticle of the seed coat has an unusual chemical composition, lacking typical mid-chain hydroxylated fatty acids but being relatively rich in other types of hydroxylated fatty acids. The cuticle of the impermeable cultivar studied contained a disproportionately high amount of hydroxylated fatty acids relative to that of the permeable ones. Moreover, a brief treatment with hot alkali released the v-hydroxy fatty acid component of the outermost cuticle and created holes in it that caused the seeds to become permeable. This demonstrates that the outermost cuticle of the seed is the critical structure that prevents water uptake by hard seeds.\\n\\nSoybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) has enormous commercial value as it is the world's largest oilseed and legume crop, and is the primary source of protein feed supplement for livestock. Many soybean cultivars have been selected for seeds that imbibe water rapidly and uniformly but even these varieties produce some hard seeds (also known as 'stone' or 'impermeable' seeds). Such seeds do not readily imbibe water when soaked, even for prolonged periods. Other varieties, many of which possess otherwise desirable agronomic traits, produce a large proportion of hard seeds (Rolston, 1978). And while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years . And while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years (Tyler, 1997), they constitute a major problem during food processing where rapid and uniform hydration is important for the production of quality soybean foods such as soymilk, tofu, and miso.

Understanding the basis for hard seed impermeability to water is an essential first step in developing strategies to handle such seeds on a large scale at the processing stage, and to plan suitable genetic modifications.\\nWhether a legume seed will be soft (permeable) or hard (impermeable) is controlled by the seed coat. This layer, largely derived from the integuments of the maternal tissue after fertilization (Esau, 1977;Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995), embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy , embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy (Bewley and Black, 1994;Baskin et al., 2000).

In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig.  and, thus, will not be considered here. In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig. 1B), the outermost layer consists of closely packed macrosclereids (palisade cells), which are dead cells with uneven wall thickenings.

Within their walls is the 'light line', a callose-rich wall area running parallel to the edge of the seed coat (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993;Ma et al., 2004). The next cell layer consists of osteosclereids (hourglass cells). These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm.

These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm. There is one intact, closely packed, uniseriate layer (herein termed aleurone) with many living cells (Yaklich et al., 1992;Ma et al., 2004) as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells. Two thin (<0.2 lm) and inconspicuous cuticles are associated with the seed coat, one on the outside of the seed (covering the palisade cells; Fig.  as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells.

Some examples are: tightly bound palisade cells (Corner, 1951;Ballard, 1973), thickened coat , thickened coat (Wyatt, 1977;Miao et al., 2001), lack of pits , lack of pits (Yaklich et al., 1986;Harris, 1987;Hahalis et al., 1996;Chachalis and Smith, 2001), presence of endocarp deposits , presence of endocarp deposits (Calero et al., 1981;Yaklich et al., 1986), dark colour , dark colour (Wyatt, 1977), closed hilum and/or micropyle , closed hilum and/or micropyle (Hyde, 1954;Ballard, 1973;Rolston, 1978;Lush and Evans, 1980), outer tangential walls of palisade cells , outer tangential walls of palisade cells (Werker et al., 1979), and a prominent light line of the palisade cells , and a prominent light line of the palisade cells (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Harris, 1987;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993).

Generally, the cuticles of the seed coat were overlooked, in part because they are very thin and do not stain readily for lipids as does a typical cuticle. However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat .

However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat (Ma et al., 2004).

These cracks were present in soft but not hard seeds. The initial penetration of water into soft seeds typically occurred on the dorsal side, the location of the majority of the cracks (Ma et al., 2004). The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.. The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.\\nIn the present study, the idea that the continuity of the outermost cuticle governs water entry into soybean seeds was confirmed experimentally. This brought up the question of why the cuticles crack in some seeds (making them soft) but not in others (making them hard). According to Ma et al. (2004), isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds. Could this property be related to the chemical composition of the cuticle? To date, no detailed analysis of any seed coat cuticle has been carried out. Accordingly, the monomer composition of both the outer and inner cuticles of a number of soybean cultivars, including those that produce predominantly soft seeds and one that produces predominantly hard seeds, was characterized. These results were further compared with the monomer compositions of cuticles from pods and leaves of the same plants. The effect of wax extraction from the outer cuticle on water imbibition by hard seeds was also determined, as wax is known to be the major contributor of hydrophobicity in leaf cuticles , isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds.

Water uptake of at least five individual seeds from each cultivar or experimental treatment was measured gravimetrically according to Ma et al. (2004)..\\n\\nIt was not possible to devise a method to remove the entire outer cuticle from a seed. However, it was possible to remove small patches of this cuticle by boiling seeds individually in 1 M NaOH for 5 min (modified from Beresniewicz et al., 1995). The alkali was removed by rinsing three times with water. Control seeds were either untreated or boiled in water for 5 min. Seeds that had split during the boiling procedures were discarded; the rest were tested for water uptake or were observed for any changes in the seed coat surface. Additionally, the NaOH solubles released from treated seeds were pooled, acidified, and extracted with CHCl 3 . These solubles were then dried, derivatized, and analysed by GC-FID/GC-MS as described for surface waxes below.. The alkali was removed by rinsing three times with water.

The CHCl 3 -soluble waxes thus extracted were evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 40 °C. The residue was quantitatively transferred to a glass vial and the solvent removed under a stream of nitrogen. After addition of a known quantity of tetracosane (as an internal standard) the dried samples were derivatized according to Riederer and Scho ¨nherr (1986). The combined methyl ester and trimethylsilyl ether derivatives were analysed by GC on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and an ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The GC was equipped with a pair of CP-Sil 5 CB low-bleed MS columns (WCOT silica 30 m3 0.25 mm ID), one in line with the FID and the other with the MS. The injector ovens were set at 250 °C, and the FID oven at 300 °C. Samples (1 ll) were injected twice (once to each column) in splitless mode and simultaneously eluted with the following oven temperature programme: the initial temperature of 80 °C was held for 2 min, followed by a rapid increase (40 °C min À1 ) to 200 °C, a 2 min hold at 200 °C, and a slower increase (3 °Cmin À1 )to300°C. The final temperature was held for just over 9 min for a total run time of 50 min. High purity He was used as a carrier gas at 1 ml min À1 .

While still wet, the coats were partially digested with pectinase so that the outer cuticle and its associated cells could be separated from the inner cuticle with its associated cells. This paradermal separation was achieved by modifying the method of Pacchiano et al. (1993). Briefly, seed coats were first treated with 1.6 mg ml À1 pectinase (from Aspergillus niger,2 5Um g À1 ; Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0) for 2 d at 31 °C. At this stage, a seed coat could be separated with forceps into an outer layer (mainly palisade and hourglass cells) and an inner layer (largely crushed parenchyma and aleurone). Alternatively, the two layers of soybean seed coats were separated after a 2 h treatment with boiling oxalic acid/oxalate solution (4 g l À1 oxalic acid, 16 g l À1 ammonium oxalate; .

From these curves it is clear that seeds from five cultivars (AC Onrei, Bobcat, Harosoy 63, Harovinton, Tachanagaha) can be categorized as soft (with varying degrees of permeability). By contrast, hard seeds selected from cv. OX-951 failed to imbibe any measurable amount of water..

By contrast, hard seeds selected from cv. OX-951 failed to imbibe any measurable amount of water.\\n\\nFive procedures were used to try to make stone seeds permeable to water. First, a brief (30 s) immersion in CHCl 3 was used to extract readily soluble waxes. However, this failed to make the stone seeds imbibe (Fig. 2B). (The extent of wax removal from the outer cuticle was judged to be nearly complete based on subsequent exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats; see below.) Next, endocarp deposits (material from the inner face of the pod that can adhere to the seed coat surface; ). (The extent of wax removal from the outer cuticle was judged to be nearly complete based on subsequent exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats; see below.) Next, endocarp deposits (material from the inner face of the pod that can adhere to the seed coat surface; Gijzen et al., 1999; Fig. ; Fig. 1D) were selectively removed from the surface of intact seeds by a brief treatment with a cellulase-pectinase mixture. Again, no change in permeability was observed (data not shown). Then, intact seeds were treated with pancreatic lipase for 20 h at room temperature. This treatment released predominantly 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids (approximately 26% of that released from the outer cuticle by BF 3 / MeOH depolymerization), albeit without any effect on permeability (data not shown). Success was ultimately achieved by boiling the seeds in 1 M NaOH for 5 min. This alkaline treatment had a striking effect on the ability of hard seeds to take up water, i.e. treated seeds imbibed quickly and hydrated as efficiently as the soft seeds (Fig. ) were selectively removed from the surface of intact seeds by a brief treatment with a cellulase-pectinase mixture. Again, no change in permeability was observed (data not shown). Then, intact seeds were treated with pancreatic lipase for 20 h at room temperature.

This alkaline treatment had a striking effect on the ability of hard seeds to take up water, i.e. treated seeds imbibed quickly and hydrated as efficiently as the soft seeds (Fig. 2). Finally, to test whether or not high temperature contributed to the softening of the seeds, hard seeds were boiled in water for 5 min but they remained true to their nature and did not imbibe (Fig. ). Finally, to test whether or not high temperature contributed to the softening of the seeds, hard seeds were boiled in water for 5 min but they remained true to their nature and did not imbibe (Fig. 2B).).\\nHot alkali treatment caused small, brown patches to appear on the light yellow seed coat (Fig. 3). This browning was probably due to oxidation of cell wall phenols exposed by de-esterification of some of the cuticle monomer components.

Additional details of the seed coat surface were observed with SEM. In control (untreated) seeds, the outer cuticle was partially obscured by endocarp deposits.

In control (untreated) seeds, the outer cuticle was partially obscured by endocarp deposits. In any area where it could be seen, the outer cuticle was smooth and continuous (Fig. 4A).

Boiling a seed in water for 5 min did not visibly affect either its endocarp deposits or its outer cuticle (Fig. 4B). By contrast, after boiling in 1 M NaOH for 5 min, small areas of the cuticle (as well as some endocarp deposits) were completely removed, revealing the outer periclinal walls of the subtending palisade cells and grooves where the individual cells abutted one another (Fig. ).

Initial analysis of whole seed coat cutin by BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization revealed the presence of fatty acids, 2-hydroxy fatty acids, and xhydroxy fatty acids as the major components. No midchain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids typical of many plant cutins (Walton, 1990;Matzke and Riederer, 1991;Kolattukudy, 2000) were detected (Fig.  were detected (Fig. 5A). This unusual cutin chemistry was contrasted with that of cuticles isolated from either soybean leaves or green pods which, after BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization, revealed a typical profile of cutin monomers including substantial amounts of 9(10),16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acids (Fig. ).

Consequently, BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization was used for all remaining cutin analyses.\\nTo determine which components of the cuticle had been removed by boiling in NaOH as described above (Figs 3,4), the aliphatics present in the NaOH hydrolysate were analysed. The aliphatic cutin monomer compounds consisted of fatty acids, 1-alkanols, n-alkanes, and x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table , the aliphatics present in the NaOH hydrolysate were analysed. The aliphatic cutin monomer compounds consisted of fatty acids, 1-alkanols, n-alkanes, and x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table 1). Interestingly, little of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid component observed with whole seed coat analyses (Fig. ). Interestingly, little of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid component observed with whole seed coat analyses (Fig. 5A) was released by NaOH treatment. Analysis of the aliphatic monomers derived from the remaining inner and outer seed coat cuticles (isolated from NaOH-treated seeds) revealed additional fatty acids, 2hydroxy acids, and smaller amounts of x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table ) was released by NaOH treatment. Analysis of the aliphatic monomers derived from the remaining inner and outer seed coat cuticles (isolated from NaOH-treated seeds) revealed additional fatty acids, 2hydroxy acids, and smaller amounts of x-hydroxy fatty acids (Table 1).).\\nNext, complete chemical analyses of the soluble wax from the outer cuticle, and the cutins from both the inner and outer cuticles (isolated and analysed separately) from permeable and impermeable seeds were made (Tables 234). From this information, it was possible to confirm that only the outer cuticle had been affected by the NaOH treatment (see below).).

The cutin monomers of the inner and outer seed coats of NaOH-treated seeds were analysed after BF 3 /MeOH depolymerization as described in Materials and methods. Values (ng mm À2 seed surface area) represent the average of triplicate measurements 6SD.\\n\\nCHCl 3 :MeOH and CHCl 3 did not yield any greater amount of n-alkanes or 1-alkanols (indicative of wax components) than that obtained from a brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table 2), indicating that the latter treatment was sufficient to remove both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes from soybean seed coat cuticles.), indicating that the latter treatment was sufficient to remove both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes from soybean seed coat cuticles.\\nOuter cuticle: Depolymerization of the extractive-free (i.e. previously exhaustively extracted with CHCl 3 :MeOH and CHCl 3 alone to remove soluble components) outer layer of soybean seed coats using BF 3 /MeOH resulted in the release of fatty acids, 2-hydroxy fatty acids, and xhydroxy fatty acids as the major components (Fig. 5A; Table ; Table 3).

Although the total amounts of cutin monomers released were not directly correlated with imbibition, the least permeable cultivar, OX-951, contained the largest amount of outer cutin monomers among the six cultivars tested. In addition, the monomer profile from seed coats of cv. OX-951 was significantly different in amount with respect to the hydroxylated fatty acid sub-classes from all other soybean cultivars tested. This relationship is clearly evident in the calculated ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids (Table  were detected.

No mid-chain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids, typical of many plant cutins ). No mid-chain hydroxy-or epoxy-derivatized fatty acids, typical of many plant cutins (Walton, 1990;Matzke and Riederer, 1991;Kolattukudy, 2000), were detected. By contrast to the data obtained for outer seed coat cuticles, there were no statistical differences between any monomer class isolated from the inner cuticle of the hard and soft seeds tested. Moreover, the ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids were lower (1:0.5) than that from the outer cuticle and did not differ between cultivars (Table , were detected.

Moreover, the ratios of fatty acids to hydroxylated fatty acids were lower (1:0.5) than that from the outer cuticle and did not differ between cultivars (Table 4).).\\n\\nTo determine whether the 2-hydroxy fatty acids observed in soybean seed coat cutin depolymerizates were sphingolipid-or cutin-derived, soybean seed coats were subjected to standard sphingolipid analysis (Cahoon and Lynch, 1991;Bonaventure et al., 2003). For comparison, living endosperm tissue from soybean seeds was also analysed. Thus, when the fatty acid components of the sphingolipid fraction isolated from soybean seed endosperm were analysed by GC-MS, the predominant (>95%) 2-hydroxy fatty acid observed was 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (Fig. . For comparison, living endosperm tissue from soybean seeds was also analysed. Thus, when the fatty acid components of the sphingolipid fraction isolated from soybean seed endosperm were analysed by GC-MS, the predominant (>95%) 2-hydroxy fatty acid observed was 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (Fig. 6), with minor amounts of 2-hydroxylated 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids. These data are in agreement with those of ), with minor amounts of 2-hydroxylated 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids. These data are in agreement with those of Sullards et al. (2000). Similarly, a sphingoid base peak was found in the long chain base fraction isolated after sphingosine hydrolysis (Fig. . Similarly, a sphingoid base peak was found in the long chain base fraction isolated after sphingosine hydrolysis (Fig. 6). By contrast, there was no phospholipid band apparent on the TLC plates of lipid extracts prepared from soybean seed coats. Nevertheless, the region of the TLC plate corresponding to phospholipids band (i.e. that which would contain sphingolipids if they were present) was isolated and subjected to hydrolysis and GC analysis. Essentially no components consistent with either 2-hydroxy fatty acids or sphingoid bases were present in the sample (Fig. ).

Regardless of their source (i.e. wax, inner or outer seed coat) all six cultivars studied had essentially the same distribution of monomers (data not shown) and these are summarized for cultivar OX-951 (Table 5). Consequently, the differences in cutin composition between cultivars lay primarily in the quantity of different aliphatic substance classes and not the presence or absence of specific components.). Consequently, the differences in cutin composition between cultivars lay primarily in the quantity of different aliphatic substance classes and not the presence or absence of specific components.\\n\\nThe results presented herein provide direct experimental evidence that the inconspicuous, outermost cuticle of a soybean seed governs its initial ability to imbibe water, a necessary prerequisite for full hydration and seed germination. Selective removal of patches of the outer cuticle with hot alkali did render the seeds capable of imbibition. In accordance with this premise, when areas of the outer cuticle were removed by hot alkali treatment, seeds were changed from hard to soft. This experimental result is consistent with an earlier anatomical study showing that soft seeds of soybean have naturally occurring, minute cracks in their outer cuticle whereas hard seeds do not (Ma et al., 2004). Knowing that it is the integrity of the outer cuticle that is responsible for hard-seededness in soybean will enable steps to be taken in the food processing industry to solve this problem, for example, scarifying seeds prior to soaking.. Knowing that it is the integrity of the outer cuticle that is responsible for hard-seededness in soybean will enable steps to be taken in the food processing industry to solve this problem, for example, scarifying seeds prior to soaking.\\nWhat components of the intact outer cuticle are responsible for its impermeability to water?\\nIn comparing the profile of wax monomers collected by CHCl 3 dip (Table 2) to that of monomers released by brief NaOH treatment (Table ) to that of monomers released by brief NaOH treatment (Table 1), it becomes clear that the NaOH treatment also removed waxes, since there are roughly equal amounts of 1-alkanols and n-alkanes in both samples. The main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.), it becomes clear that the NaOH treatment also removed waxes, since there are roughly equal amounts of 1-alkanols and n-alkanes in both samples. The main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.\\nThe origin of the additional fatty acids and x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH solubles appears to be exclusively from the outer cuticle since the chemical composition of the inner cuticle remained essentially unchanged by the alkali treatment (compare inner seed coat data for OX-951 seeds in Tables 1 and and4). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table ). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table 1) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table ) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table 2) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table ) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table 3). These data confirm that the brief surface treatment with NaOH acted only on the outer cuticle as expected. The (apparent) selective removal of x-hydroxy fatty acids by the NaOH treatment may be due, in part, to the more labile nature of alkyl esters of primary alcohols compared with either alkyl esters of secondary alcohols or alkyl esters in which there is a neighbouring a-hydroxyl group (whether it is involved in an ester or not), as may be the case for 2-OH-fatty acids. Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. ). These data confirm that the brief surface treatment with NaOH acted only on the outer cuticle as expected. The (apparent) selective removal of x-hydroxy fatty acids by the NaOH treatment may be due, in part, to the more labile nature of alkyl esters of primary alcohols compared with either alkyl esters of secondary alcohols or alkyl esters in which there is a neighbouring a-hydroxyl group (whether it is involved in an ester or not), as may be the case for 2-OH-fatty acids. Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. 2B), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components. That both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were removed by this brief exposure to solvent is supported by the observation that exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats did not yield more wax-associated components (i.e. alkanes and 1-alkanols) than brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table ), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components. That both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were removed by this brief exposure to solvent is supported by the observation that exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats did not yield more wax-associated components (i.e. alkanes and 1-alkanols) than brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table 2), although a 3-fold higher yield of fatty acids was obtained.), although a 3-fold higher yield of fatty acids was obtained.\\nThe latter are likely to have originated from the exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats, in which underlying cells, that would not have been accessible to the solvent used for surface wax dissolution, were exposed. This result is in contrast to those obtained from leaf cuticles, for which the intracuticular wax component has been shown to be responsible for its impermeable nature (Scho ¨nherr, 1982), albeit to varying degrees. The amount of wax associated with soybean seed coats (approximately 25 ng mm À2 ) is relatively low compared with that of soybean leaf cuticles (e.g. 99.663.2 ng mm À2 extracted from 13-d-old leaves by CHCl 3 dip) and the cuticle from which they were extracted much thinner. It is plausible, therefore, to assume that brief solvent extraction of the thin outer seed coat cuticle was sufficient to remove the bulk of the soluble waxes (i.e. both epiand intra-cuticular), even though this would not be possible with thicker leaf cuticles., albeit to varying degrees.

It is plausible, therefore, to assume that brief solvent extraction of the thin outer seed coat cuticle was sufficient to remove the bulk of the soluble waxes (i.e. both epiand intra-cuticular), even though this would not be possible with thicker leaf cuticles.\\n\\nThe present findings show that both the inner and outer cuticles of soybean seed coats are unique in chemical composition and that they differ significantly from typical cuticles, including those from leaves and pods of the same plant. This is especially evident in (i) the predominance of 2-hydroxy-and x-hydroxy-fatty acids, (ii) the absence of mid-chain hydroxylated fatty acids (Fig. 5; ; Walton, 1990;Kolattukudy, 2000), and (iii) the high proportion of long chain (non-wax) monomers in the monomer profile of the seed cuticle (Table , and (iii) the high proportion of long chain (non-wax) monomers in the monomer profile of the seed cuticle (Table 5).).\\nThe presence of substantial amounts of 2-hydroxy fatty acids in the present cutin depolymerizates was surprising. The seed coats from imbibed seeds were separated into inner and outer layers. The layers were extracted and analysed separately as described in the legends to Tables 2 and and3      16:0,18:0,20:0,22:0,24:0,25:0,27:0,28:0,29:0,31:0,32:0   Minor (<10%): 20:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0   Minor (<10%): 19:0,20:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0   Traces:  17:0,18:1,18:2,19:0 While this class of compounds has recently been reported as a component of Arabidopsis leaf cuticle  While this class of compounds has recently been reported as a component of Arabidopsis leaf cuticle (Franke et al., 2005), its origin remains uncertain. That is, the 2-hydroxy fatty acids reported for Arabidopsis cutins may have arisen from sphingolipids of the plasma membranes of underlying tissue. However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that the 2-hydroxy fatty acids identified in soybean seed coat cutin depolymerizates are derived from cutin: (i) the preparation from which the outer cuticle aliphatic monomer profile was obtained consisted of dead cells (mainly palisade and hourglass cells), which are unlikely to contain plasma membrane-derived lipids , its origin remains uncertain.

In addition, , the difference between hard and soft soybean seeds is the continuity of the outermost seed cuticle in the former and the presence of small cracks in the cuticles of the latter. In addition, Ma et al. (2004) reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds. Thus, the strength of the cutin polymer may be critical to forming one or the other type of seed. There are chemical differences between the components of the outermost cuticles of hard and soft seeds, and these differences may have a bearing on the tendency of cuticles to crack. In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability. reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds.

In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability.\\nAlthough a direct study of the cutin polymer was not possible, the monomer compositions of the two seed types showed intriguing differences. The most notable of these was the relatively high amount of hydroxylated components (especially 2-hydroxy fatty acids) found in the BF 3 /MeOH depolymerizate of hard seeds. The presence of a greater proportion of bi-functional (hydroxylated) fatty acids may provide a greater inter-connectivity between monomers in the cutin of hard seeds. And while bi-functional monomers themselves are not sufficient for the assembly of an integrated, three-dimensional polymer, recent evidence suggests that glycerol plays a significant role in the polyester structure of cutins (Grac xa et al., 2002) and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers. and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers.\\nThe relevance of the hydroxylated monomers is also underscored by the results of the NaOH treatment of entire hard seeds, in which the x-hydroxy fatty acid component of the outer cuticle (along with part of the fatty acid component) was extracted (compare Tables 1 and and3). This resulted in the disruption of the outer cuticle structure in discrete areas, allowing the seed to imbibe. Although the NaOH treatment resulted in removal of only patches of cuticle ). This resulted in the disruption of the outer cuticle structure in discrete areas, allowing the seed to imbibe. Although the NaOH treatment resulted in removal of only patches of cuticle (Figs 3,4), it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables , it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables 1 and and3); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions. In any case, it is clear that x-hydroxy fatty acids play an integral role in establishing or stabilizing the overall cutin structure, possibly making it resistant to cracking in the case of hard seeds. It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions.

It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.\\nNevertheless, the interaction between cutin monomers and the underlying carbohydrate cell wall matrix cannot be overlooked in establishing the differences between hard and soft soybean seeds. Indeed, preliminary evidence suggests that the structural organization of outer seed coats differs between hard-and soft-seeded cultivars (MA Bernards, S Shao, unpublished results). For example, after exhaustive enzymatic digestion with cellulase, pectinase, and hemicellulase, the amount of cutin in the outer seed coats of both Harosoy 63 and OX-951 remains <1% dry weight (data not shown). The remaining >99% is likely to be residual carbohydrates not digested by the enzymes. However, when subjected to neutral sugar analysis (Blakeney et al., 1983), approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates. The remaining 10-33% of the digested seed coats are likely to contain cutin monomers (approximately 1%), galacturonic acid (not detected in the present analysis), and possibly carbohydrate-aliphatic adducts. The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with , approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates. The remaining 10-33% of the digested seed coats are likely to contain cutin monomers (approximately 1%), galacturonic acid (not detected in the present analysis), and possibly carbohydrate-aliphatic adducts. The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with Mullin and Xu (2001). Together these data suggest the possibility that a more extensive integration (possibly due to covalent linkages) exists between cutin and carbohydrate monomers in the OX-951 cultivar, which may give the surface material either more structural integrity or greater flexibility, making it less susceptible to cracking and thereby less permeable. This idea requires further testing..

This idea requires further testing.\\nIn summary, evidence from the present study, coupled with that of Ma et al. (2004) demonstrates that hardseededness in soybean can be ascribed to the presence of an unbroken, outer cuticle covering the seed. The outer seed cuticle differs from the inner cuticle in chemical composition, and both are strikingly different from cuticles isolated from pods and leaves of the same plant. The feature of the outer cuticle that correlates with a lack of cuticular cracks is a relatively high level of hydroxylated fatty acids. It is postulated that these chemicals are critical in modifying either the degree of cross-linking of the components of the cuticle or its integration with the underlying cell wall components, thereby preventing the cuticle from cracking during development. demonstrates that hardseededness in soybean can be ascribed to the presence of an unbroken, outer cuticle covering the seed.

Merr.) has enormous commercial value as it is the world's largest oilseed and legume crop, and is the primary source of protein feed supplement for livestock. Many soybean cultivars have been selected for seeds that imbibe water rapidly and uniformly but even these varieties produce some hard seeds (also known as 'stone' or 'impermeable' seeds). Such seeds do not readily imbibe water when soaked, even for prolonged periods. Other varieties, many of which possess otherwise desirable agronomic traits, produce a large proportion of hard seeds (Rolston, 1978).\\nAnd while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years . And while hard seeds may benefit plants in nature by preserving a seed stock for several years (Tyler, 1997), they constitute a major problem during food processing where rapid and uniform hydration is important for the production of quality soybean foods such as soymilk, tofu, and miso.

Understanding the basis for hard seed impermeability to water is an essential first step in developing strategies to handle such seeds on a large scale at the processing stage, and to plan suitable genetic modifications.\\nWhether a legume seed will be soft (permeable) or hard (impermeable) is controlled by the seed coat. This layer, largely derived from the integuments of the maternal tissue after fertilization (Esau, 1977;Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995), embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy , embodies a heritable form of physical or seed coat-imposed dormancy (Bewley and Black, 1994;Baskin et al., 2000).\\nThe seed coat of soybean (Fig. .

The seed coat is modified at the hilum and micropyle areas (Fig. .

In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig.  and, thus, will not be considered here. In the remainder of the seed coat (illustrated in Fig. 1B), the outermost layer consists of closely packed macrosclereids (palisade cells), which are dead cells with uneven wall thickenings. Within their walls is the 'light line', a callose-rich wall area running parallel to the edge of the seed coat ), the outermost layer consists of closely packed macrosclereids (palisade cells), which are dead cells with uneven wall thickenings. Within their walls is the 'light line', a callose-rich wall area running parallel to the edge of the seed coat (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993;Ma et al., 2004). The next cell layer consists of osteosclereids (hourglass cells). These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm.

These cells are also dead and thick-walled, but their shape is like an hourglass and large air spaces occur between them. Next is a layer of crushed parenchyma. In addition to the above tissues derived from the integuments, the legume seed coat includes some cells of the endosperm. There is one intact, closely packed, uniseriate layer (herein termed aleurone) with many living cells (Yaklich et al., 1992;Ma et al., 2004) as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells. Two thin (<0.2 lm) and inconspicuous cuticles are associated with the seed coat, one on the outside of the seed (covering the palisade cells; Fig.  as well as irregular, small masses of crushed endosperm cells.

Some examples are: tightly bound palisade cells (Corner, 1951;Ballard, 1973), thickened coat , thickened coat (Wyatt, 1977;Miao et al., 2001), lack of pits , lack of pits (Yaklich et al., 1986;Harris, 1987;Hahalis et al., 1996;Chachalis and Smith, 2001), presence of endocarp deposits , presence of endocarp deposits (Calero et al., 1981;Yaklich et al., 1986), dark colour , dark colour (Wyatt, 1977), closed hilum and/or micropyle , closed hilum and/or micropyle (Hyde, 1954;Ballard, 1973;Rolston, 1978;Lush and Evans, 1980), outer tangential walls of palisade cells , outer tangential walls of palisade cells (Werker et al., 1979), and a prominent light line of the palisade cells , and a prominent light line of the palisade cells (Bhalla and Slattery, 1984;Harris, 1987;Serrato-Valenti et al., 1993).

Generally, the cuticles of the seed coat were overlooked, in part because they are very thin and do not stain readily for lipids as does a typical cuticle. However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat .

However, a recent, exhaustive anatomical study established that the only features consistently correlating with seed coat permeability to water were small cuticular cracks, visible with SEM, on the surface of the seed coat (Ma et al., 2004).

These cracks were present in soft but not hard seeds. The initial penetration of water into soft seeds typically occurred on the dorsal side, the location of the majority of the cracks (Ma et al., 2004). The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.. The corollary of this observation is that the intact cuticle appears to be an efficient barrier to water entry into the seed coat in soft as well as hard seeds.\\nIn the present study, the idea that the continuity of the outermost cuticle governs water entry into soybean seeds was confirmed experimentally. This brought up the question of why the cuticles crack in some seeds (making them soft) but not in others (making them hard). According to Ma et al. (2004), isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds. Could this property be related to the chemical composition of the cuticle? To date, no detailed analysis of any seed coat cuticle has been carried out. Accordingly, the monomer composition of both the outer and inner cuticles of a number of soybean cultivars, including those that produce predominantly soft seeds and one that produces predominantly hard seeds, was characterized. These results were further compared with the monomer compositions of cuticles from pods and leaves of the same plants. The effect of wax extraction from the outer cuticle on water imbibition by hard seeds was also determined, as wax is known to be the major contributor of hydrophobicity in leaf cuticles , isolated pieces of cuticle from hard seeds were stronger and less prone to breaking when handled than those isolated from soft seeds.

Selective removal of patches of the outer cuticle with hot alkali did render the seeds capable of imbibition. In accordance with this premise, when areas of the outer cuticle were removed by hot alkali treatment, seeds were changed from hard to soft. This experimental result is consistent with an earlier anatomical study showing that soft seeds of soybean have naturally occurring, minute cracks in their outer cuticle whereas hard seeds do not (Ma et al., 2004).\\nKnowing that it is the integrity of the outer cuticle that is responsible for hard-seededness in soybean will enable steps to be taken in the food processing industry to solve this problem, for example, scarifying seeds prior to soaking..

The main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.), it becomes clear that the NaOH treatment also removed waxes, since there are roughly equal amounts of 1-alkanols and n-alkanes in both samples.\\nThe main differences between these two preparations lie in the greater amount of fatty acids (approximately double in the NaOH extractives) and the presence of x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH extractives.\\nThe origin of the additional fatty acids and x-hydroxy fatty acids in the NaOH solubles appears to be exclusively from the outer cuticle since the chemical composition of the inner cuticle remained essentially unchanged by the alkali treatment (compare inner seed coat data for OX-951 seeds in Tables 1 and and4). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table ). In support of this, the sum of monomers measured in the NaOH extractives and BF 3 /MeOHdepolymerized outer seed coats of NaOH-treated OX-951 seeds (Table 1) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table ) equals that of the CHCl 3 -extracted waxes (Table 2) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table ) and BF 3 /MeOH-depolymerized outer seed coats of solvent-extracted OX-951 seeds (Table 3). These data confirm that the brief surface treatment with NaOH acted only on the outer cuticle as expected. The (apparent) selective removal of x-hydroxy fatty acids by the NaOH treatment may be due, in part, to the more labile nature of alkyl esters of primary alcohols compared with either alkyl esters of secondary alcohols or alkyl esters in which there is a neighbouring a-hydroxyl group (whether it is involved in an ester or not), as may be the case for 2-OH-fatty acids. Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. ).

Since removal of waxes from hard seeds by brief immersion in CHCl 3 alone did not result in imbibition (Fig. 2B), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components. That both epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were removed by this brief exposure to solvent is supported by the observation that exhaustive solvent extraction of isolated seed coats did not yield more wax-associated components (i.e. alkanes and 1-alkanols) than brief immersion in CHCl 3 (Table ), the impermeability of the soybean seed cuticle to water does not appear to depend on its wax component, but rather on its cutin components.

In addition, , the difference between hard and soft soybean seeds is the continuity of the outermost seed cuticle in the former and the presence of small cracks in the cuticles of the latter. In addition, Ma et al. (2004) reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds. Thus, the strength of the cutin polymer may be critical to forming one or the other type of seed. There are chemical differences between the components of the outermost cuticles of hard and soft seeds, and these differences may have a bearing on the tendency of cuticles to crack. In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability. reported that isolated pieces of cuticle from soft seeds are more delicate and prone to breakage than those from hard seeds. Thus, the strength of the cutin polymer may be critical to forming one or the other type of seed. There are chemical differences between the components of the outermost cuticles of hard and soft seeds, and these differences may have a bearing on the tendency of cuticles to crack. In other words, the softness of soybean seed coats is a result of cuticular 'crack-ability' rather than cuticular permeability.\\nAlthough a direct study of the cutin polymer was not possible, the monomer compositions of the two seed types showed intriguing differences.\\nThe most notable of these was the relatively high amount of hydroxylated components (especially 2-hydroxy fatty acids) found in the BF 3 /MeOH depolymerizate of hard seeds. The presence of a greater proportion of bi-functional (hydroxylated) fatty acids may provide a greater inter-connectivity between monomers in the cutin of hard seeds. And while bi-functional monomers themselves are not sufficient for the assembly of an integrated, three-dimensional polymer, recent evidence suggests that glycerol plays a significant role in the polyester structure of cutins (Grac xa et al., 2002) and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers. and these may provide the necessary bridging between bi-functional monomers.\\nThe relevance of the hydroxylated monomers is also underscored by the results of the NaOH treatment of entire hard seeds, in which the x-hydroxy fatty acid component of the outer cuticle (along with part of the fatty acid component) was extracted (compare Tables 1 and and3). This resulted in the disruption of the outer cuticle structure in discrete areas, allowing the seed to imbibe. Although the NaOH treatment resulted in removal of only patches of cuticle ).\\nThis resulted in the disruption of the outer cuticle structure in discrete areas, allowing the seed to imbibe. Although the NaOH treatment resulted in removal of only patches of cuticle (Figs 3,4), it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables , it extracted essentially all of the xhydroxy fatty acids (compare Tables 1 and and3); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions. In any case, it is clear that x-hydroxy fatty acids play an integral role in establishing or stabilizing the overall cutin structure, possibly making it resistant to cracking in the case of hard seeds. It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.); it seems that the outer cuticle may be rich in x-hydroxy fatty acids in localized regions. In any case, it is clear that x-hydroxy fatty acids play an integral role in establishing or stabilizing the overall cutin structure, possibly making it resistant to cracking in the case of hard seeds. It seems less likely that the NaOH treatment modified the underlying carbohydrate cell walls, and thereby making hard seeds soft, since in order to affect the cell walls the cuticle must first be breached; as soon as this occurs, imbibition can also occur.\\nNevertheless, the interaction between cutin monomers and the underlying carbohydrate cell wall matrix cannot be overlooked in establishing the differences between hard and soft soybean seeds.\\nIndeed, preliminary evidence suggests that the structural organization of outer seed coats differs between hard-and soft-seeded cultivars (MA Bernards, S Shao, unpublished results). For example, after exhaustive enzymatic digestion with cellulase, pectinase, and hemicellulase, the amount of cutin in the outer seed coats of both Harosoy 63 and OX-951 remains <1% dry weight (data not shown). The remaining >99% is likely to be residual carbohydrates not digested by the enzymes. However, when subjected to neutral sugar analysis (Blakeney et al., 1983), approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates. The remaining 10-33% of the digested seed coats are likely to contain cutin monomers (approximately 1%), galacturonic acid (not detected in the present analysis), and possibly carbohydrate-aliphatic adducts. The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with , approximately 90% of the mass of Harosoy 63 outer seed coats could be accounted for as carbohydrates, while only 67% of the outer seed coat of OX-951 could be recovered as free carbohydrates.

The profile of monosaccharides released by acid hydrolysis was similar between the two cultivars, consisting primarily of glucose and xylose; i.e. hemicellulose components (data not shown), in agreement with Mullin and Xu (2001). Together these data suggest the possibility that a more extensive integration (possibly due to covalent linkages) exists between cutin and carbohydrate monomers in the OX-951 cultivar, which may give the surface material either more structural integrity or greater flexibility, making it less susceptible to cracking and thereby less permeable. This idea requires further testing..

The outer seed cuticle differs from the inner cuticle in chemical composition, and both are strikingly different from cuticles isolated from pods and leaves of the same plant. The feature of the outer cuticle that correlates with a lack of cuticular cracks is a relatively high level of hydroxylated fatty acids. It is postulated that these chemicals are critical in modifying either the degree of cross-linking of the components of the cuticle or its integration with the underlying cell wall components, thereby preventing the cuticle from cracking during development. demonstrates that hardseededness in soybean can be ascribed to the presence of an unbroken, outer cuticle covering the seed.
