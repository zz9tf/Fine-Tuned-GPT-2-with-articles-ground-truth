The dissociation constants (Kd) for the complexes between 1,8-naphthyridine receptors 1-3 with a variety of neutral and negatively charged monosaccharides in water were determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration. The observed values are in the range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, and are similar to the Kd reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes. Among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (Kd = ~ 0.3 mM), a monosaccharide that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Interestingly, receptors 2 and 3 display the ability to discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity.",

        "INTRODUCTION": "Carbohydrate recognition is one of the most sophisticated recognition processes in biological systems [1]. This process mediates many important aspects of cell-cell recognition, such as inflammation, cell differentiation, tumor cell colonization and metastasis. In addition, the carbohydrate structures, which decorate the cell surface of higher organisms, change with the onset of cancer and inflammation, representing highly promising targets for new and more-selective anticancer drugs and for early diagnosis. However, due to its complexity and weak binding affinities, carbohydrate recognition by natural systems is still poorly understood. On the other hand, studies of synthetic carbohydrate receptors could make significant contributions to a better understanding of this process and lead to the development of new chemotherapeutics and chemosensors. Given the importance of the carbohydrate recognition process, it is not surprising that design and synthesis of artificial receptors for these important biological substrates has attracted a great deal of attention in biomimetic and supramolecular chemistry..

Given the importance of the carbohydrate recognition process, it is not surprising that design and synthesis of artificial receptors for these important biological substrates has attracted a great deal of attention in biomimetic and supramolecular chemistry. For example, artificial receptors that can selectively bind sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), a monosaccharide that is typically found at the termini of some cancer cell specific antigens (e.g., sialyl Lewis x and sialyl Lewis a), may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents that would have broad applicability to a variety of cancers [1b].. Current efforts are mainly focused on design of the receptors for complexation of mono-or disaccharides [2]. This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms . This simplification has been based on the structural studies of the lectins, carbohydrate binding proteins found in a wide range of organisms [3,[7][8][9]. Binding of an individual lectin to a monosaccharide substrate is extremely weak; the dissociation constants (K d ) for these complexes are typically in the 0.1-10 mM range. This is largely due to the solvent-exposed nature of the lectin binding sites, which make few direct contacts with monosaccharide substrate.

Binding is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and van der Waals packing of the hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains forming sandwich-type interactions.. Binding is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and van der Waals packing of the hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains forming sandwich-type interactions. Although many interesting synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in organic solvent have been developed [2], the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages. A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak. One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules , the development of synthetic receptors for binding carbohydrates in water is in the early stages. A major obstacle in the design of receptors for binding of carbohydrates in water lies in the structural complexity of carbohydrates and the fact that hydrogen-bonding interactions in water are weak. One of the possible solutions to overcome this obstacle could be achieved by the construction of water-soluble macrocyclic types of receptor molecules [5]. These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin . These receptors possess the necessary three-dimensional structure, suitable flexibility and lipophilic binding pocket where binding can occur through a combination of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between receptor molecules and carbohydrate substrates. Literature examples of carbohydrate receptors based on cyclodextrin [6], calixarene , calixarene [7], porphyrin , porphyrin [8] or cage-type molecules  or cage-type molecules [9] showed that it is possible to design and synthesize artificial receptors for binding carbohydrates in water, although stabilities of their complexes are weak. These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P. Davis et al. represents another interesting approach in the design of artificial carbohydrate receptors  showed that it is possible to design and synthesize artificial receptors for binding carbohydrates in water, although stabilities of their complexes are weak. These receptors bind carbohydrates mainly through hydrophobic interactions. The cage-type isophthalimide based tetracyclic receptor molecule recently reported by A. P. Davis et al. represents another interesting approach in the design of artificial carbohydrate receptors [10]. This molecule can bind selectively all-equatorial disaccharides such as cellobiose in water within the range of values reported for lectins. As in previously mentioned examples, hydrophobic attractions supported by CH-interactions are the driving forces for the binding of disaccharides. In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation .

In comparison, binding of monosaccharide substrates by this receptor is rather weak (K d = >50 mM). The only synthetic receptors that are very effective in water depend on boronate formation [2b, 11]. Boronic acid is known to react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of carbohydrates to form five or six-membered cyclic esters in basic aqueous media. However, these systems cannot be considered as biomimetic due to the fact that binding and recognition occurs only through covalent bond formation. Recently it was shown that receptors designed from condensed polypyridine units .

Recently it was shown that receptors designed from condensed polypyridine units [12] display very strong and selective binding of various carbohydrates in organic solvents, including polar methanol, mainly through formation of hydrogen bonds.

Therefore, condensed polypyridines present attractive building blocks for construction of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules. We report here the design, synthesis and binding properties of 1,8-naphthyridine based acyclic 1, bi-bracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic 3 receptor, Fig. (1), molecules toward the various monosaccharide substrates in aqueous buffer at pH 6.5.

Our synthetic receptors are relatively small, have the desired threedimensional structure, hydrogen-bonding site and lipophilic binding pocket to promote hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.",
        "RECEPTOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES": "Macrocyclic structures are particularly useful for design of artificial carbohydrate receptor molecules mainly because they are large enough to contain a spherical binding site (lipophylic cavity) of appropriate size and shape. Incorporation of condensed polypyridine units into such macrocyclic structure could result in construction of artificial receptors capable of selective carbohydrate binding in water through combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, condensed polypyridine compounds exhibit strong absorption and fluorescence emission bands, and complexation induced changes in their absorption or fluorescence spectra will allow for the determination of the stability constants. To demonstrate the suitability of macrocyclic polypyridine structures for design of artificial receptors capable of binding carbohydrate substrates in water, we synthesized three types of 1,8naphthyridine based receptor molecules 1-3, Fig. (1).. 1,8-Naphthyridine moiety has been successfully used in design of receptors for monosaccharide binding in organic solvents [12e,f], and there is strong literature evidence demonstrating that replacement of pyridine or pyrimidine with naphthyridine core moiety in some acyclic carbohydrate receptors resulted in a significant enhancement of the receptor's binding properties [12f]. However, this monosaccharide binding motif remains largely unexploited in the design and synthesis of receptors for binding and recognition of these important biological substrates in water. Synthesized bibracchial macrocyclic 2 and cage-type macrobicyclic receptor 3 possess a 1,8-naphthyridine core moiety bridged with two flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amines (TREN). In these receptors, two adjacent pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as the proton acceptors (AA), while lateral TREN secondary amines function as the proton donors (DD). The relay of hydroxyl groups in monosaccharides offers an ADDA motif complementary to the DAAD array of naphthyridine receptors to form multiple H-bonds [13]. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.. In addition, our synthesized receptor molecules differ in their flexibility and, therefore, in their conformational adaptability toward carbohydrate substrates.",
        "SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECEPTORS 1-3": "1,8-Naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4, a key receptor intermediate, was synthesized over five steps as previously reported [14]. Condensation of 1,8-naphthyridine dicarbaldehyde 4 with an equimolar amount of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) followed by treatment with NaBH 4 yields a mixture of receptors 2 (30%) and 3 (15%), Scheme 1. However, if the 2:3 ratio of 4 and TREN is used, the major product formed is receptor 3 (45%) while 2 cannot be detected. In both cases pure 2 and 3 were obtained after RP-HPLC purification of crude reaction mixtures. Compound 1 was prepared for control studies by condensation of 4 with two equivalents of propylamine using the same synthetic strategy. After solvent evaporation, the oily residue was redissolved in water containing 0.1 % TFA, and the final product 1 was purified by RP-HPLC. The product 1 was obtained in 60% yield. Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells .

Considering the importance of carbohydrate recognition in tumor development and the strong literature evidence showing that tumor cells have a lower extracellular pH (~6.8) than normal cells [15], we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. The pH titration and changes of the UV/vis absorption of receptor 2 as a function of pH were used as an indicator of the suitability of this pH for the binding studies. The pK a values obtained for aromatic, terti- ary, secondary and primary nitrogens of receptor 2 were 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, and 10.7, respectively. In the case of UV/vis experiments, lowering the pH of the receptor 2 solution from 11 to 8 caused a decrease of the absorption intensity at 315 nm, while further lowering the pH of the solution from 8 to 1 resulted in the opposite effect. In this case, the absorption intensity increased with a bathochromic shift of the maximum wavelength ( max =319 nm, pH 1), associated with the formation of an isosbestic point at 274 nm. Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds , we decided to perform all our spectroscopic measurements in cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5.

Similar dependence of UV/vis spectra on pH was observed for 3. Our experimental findings are in accordance with the data previously reported in the literature for similar compounds [16] indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39)  indicating that protonation occurs firstly at primary and secondary nitrogen sites in TREN bridges, while protonation of remaining aromatic nitrogens require much lower pH (pK a for unsubstituted 1,8-naphthyridine is 3.39) [17]. Based on these experiments, we can assume that at pH 6.5 in receptors 1-3 only lateral TREN primary and secondary amines will be protonated, allowing desired DAAD H-bonding arrangement for optimal interactions with monosaccharide substrates. The repulsive interactions between positively charged TREN bridges may be expected to prevent complete self-stacking of 1,8-naphthiridine units in both receptors 2 and 3 thus creating a hydrophobic binding pocket. Although the TREN bridges in both macrocyclic receptors are flexible enough to allow the binding pocket to adjust to carbohydrate substrate for optimal interactions, a greater degree of structural flexibility and conformational adaptability may be expected for the receptor 2. Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions..

Therefore, we may expect that synthesized receptor molecules 2 and 3 can complex carbohydrates in water by combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The 1,8-naphthyridine receptors 1-3 showed pronounced differences in their UV/vis and fluorescence spectra. As expected, comparison of the UV/vis spectra of reference compound 1 and receptors 2 and 3 taken in an aqueous buffer (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c buffer = 0.05 M, c 1 = 2 10 -4 M, max 1= 312 nm, 1 = 4725.7 M -1 cm -1 , c 2 = 10 -4 M, max 2= 315 nm, 2 = 7372.5 M -1 cm -1 , c 3 = 6.7 10 -5 , max 3= 316 nm, 3 = 13713.0 M -1 cm -1 ), shows a hypochromicity ( 3 <3 1, 2 <2 1 ), an absorption band broadening and bathochromic shift for 2 and 3. Observed effects are indicative of the presence of weak intramolecular -stacking interactions between the 1,8naphthyridine units; strong stacking interactions are reported to produce more pronounced hypochromicity and bathochromic shift [16a,c]. In the fluorescence emission spectra of compounds 1-3 taken also in aqueous buffer and at comparable fluorophore concentrations (sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; c 1 = 6 10 -6 M, excit 1=320 nm, emiss 1=375 nm, I max 1=767, c 2 =3 10 -6 M, excit 2=320 nm, emiss 2= 375 nm, I max 2= 392, c 3 =2 10 -6 M, excit 3=320 nm, emiss 3=375 nm, I max 3=189), the emission intensity (I max ) observed for 2 and 3 is two and four times lower than the emission intensity of reference compound 1, supporting our previous finding of weak intramolecular stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions can be eliminated as a possible cause for the fluorescence quenching since fluorescence emission of 1-3 is linearly dependent on their concentrations within the range of 10 -6 -10 -5 M. In contrast to H 2 O solutions, D 2 O solutions of 2 and 3 exhibited 34% and 30% increase in the fluorescence intensities, respectively, suggesting the possibility of another fluorescence quenching mechanism in addition to the intramolecular stacking interactions, Fig. (2). An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer . An identical effect of D 2 O on fluorescence intensity was reported for ethidium bromide (a tricyclic aromatic amine), and it was interpreted by excited state quenching caused with solute to solvent proton transfer [18]. In this case, the low fluorescence intensity of free ethidium bromide in water was attributed to proton transfer from the excited singlet state to water molecules, while the increase of fluorescence intensity in D 2 O was attributed to a reduction in the proton transfer rate. Similarly, the observed decrease in the fluorescence intensities upon titration of receptors 2 or 3 with certain monosaccharide substrates can be partially explained by the proton transfer rate reduction as a consequence of monosaccharide complexation..

        "BINDING STUDIES": "All examined carbohydrate substrates are commercially available. The binding affinities of receptors 1-3 toward a variety of monosaccharide substrates were examined by UV/vis, and fluorometric titration experiments in cacodylate buffer (0.05 M) at pH 6.5, and room temperature, Fig. 3 (A) and and(C). In all experiments the concentration of receptor was kept constant (c 2 =10 -4 M, c 3 =6 10 -5 M for UV/vis, and c 2 =10 -6 M, c 3 =2 10 -6 M for fluorimetric titrations), whereas the concentration of carbohydrate substrates was varied from cca 10 -5 -4 10 -2 M in the case of UV/vis and cca 10 -5 -10 -3 M in the case of fluorimetric titration experiments.

All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table ). All the substrates tested did not change appreciably the fluorescence or absorption spectra of reference compound 1 even at high substrate concentrations (500 fold excess with respect to concentration of 1). As shown in Table 1, receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution. Affinities toward neutral substrates are much lower and thus not determinable by fluorescence or UV/vis titration experiments under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharides mainly through charge-charge interactions and that hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions play a negligible role or no role in the complex stabilization. In support of this, no significant differences in affinities of receptor 3 toward negatively charged substrates was observed. Obtained results can be explained by the lack of flexible 2-aminoethyl \"arms\" in receptor 3 and somewhat more sterically hindered binding pocket so that complete substrate encapsulation cannot occur. On the other hand, the conformationally more flexible receptor 2 showed millimolar affinities toward neutral hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose, as well as negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and sialic acid. However, receptor 2 has the highest affinity for negatively charged sialic acid (K d = ~ 0.3 mM, Table , receptor 3 binds negatively charged monosaccharide substrates with millimolar affinities in aqueous solution.

These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability.), roughly an order of magnitude higher than for all other substrates tested. These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the charge-charge interactions, significantly contribute to the overall complex stability. In order to examine the role of hydrogen bonds in stabilization of the complexes, various neutral pyranose and deoxy-pyranose   substrates were investigated. Among these substrates, receptor 2 shows binding preferences for glucose over deoxy-glucose substrates (Table 1) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose. As in previous cases, the stability constants for these complexes also were not determinable by fluorimetric and UV/vis titration experiments. This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction.) clearly indicating that the number of hydroxyl groups which this receptor can interact with is crucial for the complex stability. The stability constants for the complexes with deoxyglucoses were not determinable by fluorimetric or UV/vis titrations under the same experimental conditions. Additional evidence for hydrogen bonding was found in titration of 2 with somewhat smaller pentoses such as D-xylose and D-ribose.

This could be due to the smaller ring size of the pentose substrates, but also (as in the case of the deoxy-glucoses) due to the number of hydroxyl groups available for interaction. In the case of two bigger disaccharide substrates, D-trehalose and D-gentiobiose (both composed of two glucose units), the K d values determined for receptor 2 are comparable to those of glucose, suggesting that only one glucose unit of these disaccharides participate in the binding. We can assume that receptor 2's relatively flexible and less sterically hindered structure allows formation of such complexes. Besides binding to monosaccharides in water with different affinities, receptors 2 and 3 also display the ability to qualitatively discriminate between closely related monosaccharide substrates by opposite variation of the fluorescence emission intensity as illustrated in Fig. (5). Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates.. Fluorescence quenching was observed for titration of 2 with galactose and glucose-6phosphate, while fluorescence enhancement was observed for glucose and glucose-1-phosphate substrates. A similar trend in fluorescence intensity was observed for the titration of 3 with negatively charged glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. An extensive literature search resulted in only one example of artificial receptors capable of discriminating between closely related monosaccharides in aqueous solutions. Cu(II)-coordinated glucose-imprinted poly(acrilate) receptor, reported by S. Striegler [21], has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation , has higher affinity toward glucose over galactose or mannose at physiological pH. In this case the selectivity factors were determined by HPLC and GS MS analyses and reported to be 8.3 for galactose and 9.0 for mannose. Complexation induced conformational changes [16a, c, 22] in receptors 2 and 3 and/or reduction in the rate of proton transfer from the secondary nitrogens of each receptor molecule to solvent caused by possible participation of these nitrogens in complexation [18] can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. can possibly explain observed variations in the fluorescence emission intensities. The observed 1:1 stoichiometry for complexes of 2 and 3 with monosaccharide substrates and the fact that the stability constants for 1 are very low and thus not determinable by UV/vis or fluorescence titrations indicate that complexation occurs by insertion of the substrate molecule into each receptor's lipophilic pocket. Additional evidence for the formation of inclusion type of complexes were found in 1 H NMR titration of receptor 2 with sialic acid, the receptor/substrate system that forms one of the most stable complexes in water, Table 1. 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. . 1 H NMR titration experiment was carried out in deuterated cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pD=6.0) at room temperature, Fig. (6). The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. . The concentration of 2 was kept constant at 6.5 x 10 -3 M while the sialic acid concentration was varied form 6.3 10 -3 -7.53 10 -2 M. Marked downfield chemical shifts were observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of receptor 2's aromatic protons of up to 0.3 ppm upon addition of sialic acid substrate accompanied with the sharpening of receptor 2's aromatic signals (possibly caused by changing receptor 2's conformation and increasing the distance between aromatic moieties to accommodate sialic acid substrate). 1 H NMR spectra of sialic acid were also changed due to complex formation, Fig. (6). The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed. On the other hand, increase in the intensity of amide signal in D 2 O cannot be only attributed to the complex formation because it parallels concentration increase of the free sialic acid in solution. Overlap of the signals in the aliphatic region of the spectra prevents its use for the complex analysis. Also, due to lower sensitivity of the NMR experiment, higher mM concentrations of receptor 2 and sialic acid had to be used. However, at these concentrations the complex precipitation was observed, preventing the utilization of obtained 1 H-NMR chemical shifts for the K d determination.. The most dramatic change was observed for sialic acid amide proton. Observed downfield chemical shift of this particular proton is possible only if the inclusion complex with receptor 2 is formed.

However, at these concentrations the complex precipitation was observed, preventing the utilization of obtained 1 H-NMR chemical shifts for the K d determination.",
        "CONCLUSION": "The present results demonstrate that macrocyclic bi-bracchial 1,8-naphthyridine receptor 2 is capable of binding and recognizing monosaccharide substrates in water through multiple noncovalent interactions. The dissociation constants (K d ) of these complexes, determined by fluorimetric and UV/vis titrations, cover a wide range from ~ 0.3 to 10 mM, thus displaying selectivity with respect to substrate charge, size, number and pattern of hydrogen bonding. Significantly, among the monosaccharide substrates tested, receptor 2 showed the strongest binding affinity for sialic acid (K d = ~0.3 mM), a monosaccharide found at the termini of cell surface glycoconjugates that plays many important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes [23]. This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes . This result can be explained by electrostatic and structural complementarity between receptor 2 and sialic acid substrate, and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in sialic acid binding and recognition. Importantly, the affinities of 2 toward monosaccharide substrates in solution, particularly sialic acid, are comparable to those reported for lectin/monosaccharide complexes [4, 23b]. With these studies, we confirmed our initial design principles and showed that receptor molecule 2 represents a promising basis for the development of new and more efficient carbohydrate receptors that may have broad applications in bio-analytical and medicinal fields. An investigation of receptor's 2 interactions with more complex carbohydrate substrates, molecular modeling studies and synthesis of its polyvalent derivatives are currently underway..

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Information. All commercially available chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer and referenced according to a residual solvent peak as an internal standard (DMSO 2.49 ppm, and CD 3 OD, 4.78 ppm). RP-HPLC analyses of reaction mixtures and products purification were performed on Finnigan SpectraSYSTEM liquid chromatography system. For RP-HPLC separation, a Phenomenex Jupiter C-18 preparative column, (250 x 21.2 mm, 10 m particle size, 300 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 7 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) or Vydac C-18 analytical column (250\u00b4 4.6 mM, 5 m particle size, 120 \u00c5 pore size, flow rate 1 mL/min with linear gradient from 0% -100% B over 70 min.) was employed, and eluting products were detected by UV at 315 nm. A solvent system consisting of 0.1% TFA in H 2 O (v/v) as A and 0.1% TFA in CH 3 CN (v/v) as B was used for HPLC elution. Mass spectral data were obtained via the Mass Spectrometry Services operated by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. UV/vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 3 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra on a Perkin Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer.",
        "Preparation of Control Compound 1": "n-Propylamine (0.191 mL, 1.32 mmol) was added to a solution of 1,8-naphthyridine-2,7-carboxaldehyde (200mg, 1.16 mmol) in dry CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (150 mL, 1:1 v/v) under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent mixture was evaporated without heating under reduced pressure. The oily residue was redissolved in dry CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (150 mL), cooled to 0 \u00b0C, and NaBH 4 (51 mg, 1.3 mmol) was slowly added.

        "Binding Studies": "The stability constant of the complexes between 1,8naphthyridine receptor 2 and various monosaccharides were determined by UV/vis titration experiments in cacodylate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5) at room temperature. In these experiments the concentration of receptor 2 or 3 was kept constant (8 10 -5 M) while the concentration of monosaccharide substrates was varied from 3 10 -5 M to 1.8 10 -3 M. The monosaccharide substrates were prepared in aqueous solution of the receptor (8 10 -5 M) in order to keep the receptor concentration constant. Under these conditions the UV/vis absorbance of the receptor 2 was proportional to its concentrations.
